You're just saying that to make me feel better about myself.

I'm not. I mean it.

sharing myself with other people.

418
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,420
Because...

00:25:55,290 --> 00:26:00,230
I'm always giving and not so much receiving.

With Roman, it's fifty-fifty.

Well, it was. I mean, we...

Just life.

Growing up, we were attached by the hip, obviously, but...

I think it's harder for him.

There's a photo of us as kids where we're wearing

I could not tell you which one I am in the picture.
到现在我都认不出哪一个是我

432
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,930
It's crazy.
很离谱吧

433
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,720
I was "We."

And now, I'm "I."

Roman comes home and has a broken foot.

Oh. Oh, my God, that's adorable.

He probably, like, dropped a bowling ball

I've never broken a bone.

Oh, no. Now, it's gonna happen.

It's like a thing. You can't say that.

Ugh, lobster? You're killing me.

don't you think?

Hey, can I ask you a personal question?

So I had this amazing date with a guy,

and we both like really good sandwiches,
我俩都爱特好吃的三明治

我周一发消息问他“今晚一起吃三明治？”

又问“明天 周三 周四 周五 哪天行？”

结果他都没回

477
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,960
That's too bad.
真可惜

478
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,960
- Onto the next. - Well, I'm not done.
- 换棵树吧 - 我还没说完

479
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,590
So I followed up with him on Tuesday,

480
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,960
"Actually, can't do Thursday," even though I could.
说“其实周四不行” 实际能

481
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,640
"How's tomorrow, aka Wednesday or Friday?"
“明天怎么样 或者周三周五？”

PS, how was your day?"

483
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,940
And nothing.
结果依旧没回

484
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:53,140
How long do you think I should wait before I text him again?
你觉得下次什么时候再问？

485
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,350
Never text him again.

Hi, Dennis.

- 呃 还好 能问你个私事吗？ - 嗯

to a potential soulmate before you stop respecting yourself?

Eight hours awake and four hours asleep.

You're such a great guy.

Maybe he's just really busy.

I forgot it was just a dream.
才记起那不过是场梦

551
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:16,540
We don't bite.

Oh, sorry. I think I'm lost.

You can just listen if you want.

What's your twin's name?

Rocky was scared of the dark when we were kids.
我们小时候 罗基很怕黑

557
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,820
We had bunk beds,
我们睡的是上下铺

558
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,680
but me and him would always share the top bunk.

559
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,090
So, the monsters couldn't get him.

Then one night, he said that he wasn't afraid.

562
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,750
Fucking pissed me off.
他这话把我气翻了

563
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,770
We were probably too old to be sharing a bed
大概我们已经大到了不需要同床

564
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,500
at that point, anyway.
反正当时就那样

I didn't know you wanted to be a lawyer.

573

Okay, well, have a good night.

We were just trying to get some froyo,

So, where'd you learn to beat people up?
所以 你在哪儿学的功夫？

744
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:12,240
I took a little karate as a kid,
小时候学过点空手道

745
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:14,910
but I quit when I didn't make blue belt.
没拿到蓝带就不学了

746
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,360
Then I guess I dabbled in some MMA after high school,
高中后练过点综合格斗

condone violence or something.
你会反对暴力什么的

For the first half.
前半段算是自卫

756

00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,830
You know, I actually got hit on there the other day.
前几天在健身房我被人搭讪了

I thought maybe the guy knew Rocky, so, uh,
我以为那人认识罗基

766
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:24,420
I just went with it.

What did he say?
他都说了什么？

768
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:28,650
He was like, "Someone's been working their arms."
他说“手臂练得不错嘛”

769
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:31,840
- He did not say that. - Yeah, he did. Yeah, he...
- 你编的吧 - 他真说了

770
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:34,360
Then I said, uh, "Yeah,

771
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:36,810
you know, I've been working 'em real good."

You're such a tease.

773
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,070
What? I experimented.

774
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,630
- You did? - Mm.

...kissed a guy at a party once.

777
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:57,450
It was after Rocky came out.

778
00:47:57,470 --> 00:48:00,240
I think I was just trying to understand.
我是想试着理解罗基

779
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:04,900
I never told him that.
这事我从来没给他说过

780
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:15,010
You could talk to me like I'm Rocky.
把当我是罗基 跟我说吧

781
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:25,760
Yeah, so you're dead now.
现在死了吧

782
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:29,570
That's what you get for not looking both ways.

You only wanna look forward.

we had a real conversation.
我们什么时候真心聊过

787
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:45,480
That wasn't, "How's work?" You know, "How's Mom?"
除了“工作怎样” “妈怎样”那种客套话

788
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:50,440
And it's always on your time too.
地球都得围着你转

Better things to do, right?

You wished me a "happy birthday" the day after.

And, I mean, I know you didn't forget.

Like, I'm-I'm pretty stupid, but I'm not that fucking stupid.
我虽傻 可没傻到那程度

793
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:08,710
You know, I actually waited until midnight, just in case,
我还特意等到晚上十二点 就怕错过

794
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:12,370
and... and the second it...

795
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:16,210
Well, I snapped, 'cause...

796
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:19,700
to be honest, you're so fucking selfish.
你太自私了

Like, what, you don't-- you... you don't wanna deal with me?
你就是不想理我

抱歉 我不关心时政

799

You know what?

It's your fucking fault we're like this.
这都怪你

Yeah, you couldn't wait to get away. I mean, I would've,

I would've followed you to college.
我本可跟你去上大学

804

If you weren't like me, and we weren't the same,
我怕我们不一样的话

819
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,540
then... then I wouldn't know who I was, you know?
我就找不到自我了

820
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,430

That's interesting, yeah.
有意思

967
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:02,250
I mean, everyone at work sees you a certain way,

so I tried to avoid infecting anyone,

and I think I made a bad impression.

Lateral. you're moving sideways.
“乔迁”意思是搬家

1535
01:30:10,030 --> 01:30:13,020
but I can't think of a use for it.
升职都说“升迁”

1536
01:30:13,570 --> 01:30:14,540

Wasn't sure if it was in poor taste or not, but...

1550

For hitting you like I did.

It's all right.

1559
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:41,740
No, it's not. I shouldn't have done that.
不 真的不对 我不该动手

1560
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:46,280
I think I outclassed you in that department.

01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:50,110
Yeah, I just don't, um...

I don't understand how someone could...

I mean, who are you?

You know how people say "just be yourself"?

Like, what version of me? I hate most of them.
可哪个自己啊？我不喜欢大部分的我
