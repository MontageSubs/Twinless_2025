12
00:01:33,246 --> 00:01:35,024
真替你难过
I'm so sorry for your loss.

需要的话 我都在...
I'm-I'm here if you...

天呐 你长得太像他了
Oh, God. Your face.

15
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,081
其实 看起来不像
It doesn't-- Actually, it doesn't seem like

16
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:29,249
你在努力做好你的工作 不 看起来...
you are trying to do your job. No, looks like--

17
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:30,918
你更像是在帮倒忙
It feels like you're doing the opposite of your job

18
00:02:31,052 --> 00:02:32,419
因为 应该非常容易就可以注销掉...
'cause it should be pretty easy to cancel

19
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:34,022
- 我死去的兄弟的账户 - 你想注销吗？
- my dead brother's account. - Do you want this?

20
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,455
- 我不知道  - 妈 我不知道
- I don't know. - Ma, I don't know.

- Do you want these? - I-- Mom, please.

23
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:42,162
别跟我说什么别激动！
Don't tell me to fucking calm down!

24
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,197
我都打了差不多一个小时的电话了
I've been on the phone for, like, an hour--

25
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:47,101
- 喂？操！- 罗曼
- Hello? Fuck! - Roman,

26
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:48,970
要我帮你留着还是丢掉？
do you want me to keep these or throw them away?

27
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:51,039
- 我们非得现在弄吗？ - 我们没有房间
- Do we have to do this now? - We don't have the room,

28
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,439
但 如果你什么都想留着...

29
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:54,207
我们明天再弄不行吗？为什么？
Can we just do this tomorrow, please? Why?

30
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,643
因为我明天就要回去了
Because I'm going back tomorrow.

31
00:02:55,777 --> 00:02:57,210
知道了 但是我还在这里啊 所以就这样吧
Okay, but I'm gonna be here, so just leave it.

32
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,780
你要一个人收拾整个公寓吗？
You're gonna pack up this entire apartment?

33
00:02:58,913 --> 00:03:00,213
- 对 对 - 哦 太有意思了

我自己来弄...什么？
I'll do it myself-- What?

35
00:03:01,783 --> 00:03:03,618
我觉得你不该留在这 我觉得
I don't think you should stay here. I don't think

36
00:03:03,751 --> 00:03:05,185
-这对你有好处 -哦 拜托 你不知道
- it's good for you. - Oh, come on. You don't know

37
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:06,854
妈妈 什么叫对我有好处？你永远不知道
what's good for me, Mom. You never knew

38
00:03:06,988 --> 00:03:08,355
- 什么对我有好处 好吗？- 好吧
- what was good for me. Okay? - All right.

39
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:09,891
- 你在说笑吗？ - 好吧 那就没关系了
- You kidding me? - Well, then never mind.

40
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:11,526
- 我不管了  - 很好
- I won't help you. - Good.

41
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:13,061
- 什么都你自己来弄  - 这就是这么想的
- You can do all this yourself. - That's what I'm saying.

42
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,529
- 那就...走吧 - 我回酒店去
- That's-- Go. - I'll go back to the hotel.

44
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:17,999
够了！
Time-out!

45
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:22,837
罗曼
Roman.

46
00:03:24,706 --> 00:03:26,206
你需要帮助
You need help.

47
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:28,743
你才需要帮助
You need help.

48
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,546
嗯 确实如此
Well, that's true.

49
00:03:49,197 --> 00:03:50,598
大家好
Hello, everyone.

50
00:03:50,732 --> 00:03:53,901
现在七点了 我们开始吧
It's seven o'clock, so I say let's get started.

51
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:56,671
我发现今天有一些新面孔
I see some new faces here today,

52
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:59,707
所以我想大家来做一个有趣的绕圈自我介绍
so I thought it would be fun to go in a circle.

53
00:03:59,841 --> 00:04:01,241
说出你的名字
Say your name,

54
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:04,411
名字首字母相同的蔬菜
a vegetable that starts with the same first letter

55
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:08,716
还有 别怀念你的同胞胎了
and one thing you don't miss about your twin.

56
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,086
夏洛特 胡萝卜
Charlotte. Carrot.

57
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:16,624
我一点也不怀念克莱尔抢了我的男朋友那事
I don't miss Claire stealing my boyfriend.

58
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:19,026
别当真 我开玩笑的
No, I'm kidding.

59
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,728
我开玩笑的 我们不搞绕圈自我介绍
I'm kidding. We won't go in a circle.

60
00:04:20,862 --> 00:04:23,064
但是克莱尔确实抢了我的男朋友
But Claire, she really did steal my boyfriend.

61
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:26,868
他分不清我们俩 不过还是可以算她抢的 对吧？
He couldn't tell us apart. But it still counts, right?

62
00:04:30,171 --> 00:04:31,806
我怀念她的笑声
I miss her laugh.

63
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:35,109
我们以前总是一起笑
We always laughed together.

64
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:39,412
我们还说要模仿艾伯特和科斯特洛来一段双人喜剧
We talked about doing this Abbott and Costello routine.

65
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:41,448
但我太害羞了
But I was too shy.

66
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:45,086
所以我对自己说：那我试试单口喜剧好了
So, I said to myself I'll try stand-up.

67
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:48,790
没错 现在我就要在你们身上试试笑话
Yep, and I'm about to test jokes on you,

68
00:04:48,923 --> 00:04:50,390
请多包涵
so bear with me.

69
00:04:51,192 --> 00:04:53,426
准备好了吗？好
Okay, you ready? All right.

70
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:55,963
有双胞胎的请举手
Raise your hand if you have a twin.

71
00:04:56,097 --> 00:04:58,733
好的
Okay.

72
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:00,735
真是一群好观众
This is a good crowd.

73
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:03,504
很多人总喜欢问
You know, so many people, they're always asking,

74
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:05,173
“谁大一些？”
"Who's older?"

75
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,842
现在我大一些 因为她已经死了
I am now that she's dead.

76
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,746
作为双胞胎 你会把你和另一半的差异都刻在心里
As a twin, it's like you internalize the difference

77
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,781
你和你的另一半之间
between you and your other half.

78
00:05:13,915 --> 00:05:16,851
克莱尔外向些 克莱尔漂亮些
Claire's the outgoing one, Claire's the beautiful one,

79
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,352
克莱尔感染了衣原体
Claire's the one with chlamydia.

80
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,155
我很伤心
I was so upset

81
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:23,825
她感染衣原体时我不在
when she got chlamydia without me.

82
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:28,629
毕竟我们什么都该一起做的嘛
We're supposed to do everything together.

83
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:51,118
呃 我反正不吃那个 吃起来像球一样
Oh, I wouldn't eat that. Tastes like balls.

84
00:05:52,587 --> 00:05:55,723
嗯 我喜欢吃球
Mm, I like balls.

85
00:05:55,857 --> 00:05:56,791
哦
Oh.

86
00:05:58,292 --> 00:05:59,727
嗯
Mm.

87
00:05:59,861 --> 00:06:03,363
噢 天啦 太糟了
Oh, my God, that's so bad.

88
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:06,901
你是 呃...
Are you, uh...

89
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,803
我是……？
Am I...?

90
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:11,539
哦 只是...你说你喜欢吃球 所以……
Oh, just-- You said you like balls, so...

91
00:06:13,975 --> 00:06:16,510
我的兄弟洛基是个同性恋
Rocky, my brother, was gay.

92
00:06:18,346 --> 00:06:19,680
你们是双胞胎？
Was your twin?

93
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:22,650
嗯...不
Um... No.

94
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:24,185
好
Right.

95
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,888
这很奇怪 是吧？
It's weird, isn't it?

96
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:29,757
呃 表观遗传学
Uh, epigenetics.

97
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:33,861
- 呃... - 它们是你从基因中继承的
- Uh... - They're the things you inherit on top of your DNA.

98
00:06:33,995 --> 00:06:36,264
它们可能会表达偏差
They may account for discrepancies

99
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,932
同卵双胞胎之间
between identical twins.

100
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:39,700
哈
Huh.

101
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:41,502
嘿 你晕车吗？
Hey, do you get carsick?

102
00:06:42,036 --> 00:06:44,105
- 有时 为什么？- 哦
- Sometimes. Why? - Oh.

103
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:46,107
洛奇总是坐在前排
Rocky always had to sit in the front seat

104
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,576
当我们还是孩子的时候 并且...
when we were kids, and...

105
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:50,077
我不知道 我只是觉得
I don't know, I just thought

106
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:53,614
这可能与同性恋基因有关
maybe that was connected to, like, the gay gene.

107
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:55,415
如果有的话
If there is one.

108
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:58,052
并不是说有这样的人
Not that there is one.

109
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:01,756
呃 这只是个想法 我不是科学家
Uh, it was just an idea. I'm no scientist.

110
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:05,293
对 是有同性恋基因
Um, well, there is a gay gene.

111
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,229
我们把橙色看作蓝色 把蓝色看作橙色
Uh, we see orange as blue and blue as orange.

112
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:10,097
这就是为什么有这么多同性恋
That's why there's so many homosexuals

113
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:12,432
- 在时尚界 - 哦 对吧？
- in the fashion industry. - Oh. See?

114
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:15,403
好吧 就这样
Well, there you go.

115
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,272
对不起 你知道我在开玩笑吧？
I'm sorry, you know that I'm joking, right?

116
00:07:18,406 --> 00:07:19,807
那 那不是真的
That-that's not true.

117
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:23,311
是的 不 我知道
Yeah. No, I knew that.

118
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:25,478
好的
Okay.

119
00:07:27,882 --> 00:07:29,984
我是 D——呃 我是丹尼斯
I'm D-- uh, I'm Dennis.

120
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,919
羅馬
Roman.

121
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:40,895
- 你的双胞胎叫什么名字？ - 你饿了吗？
- What was your twin's name? - Are you hungry?

122
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:42,596
- 抱歉 什么？ - 抱歉 我只是想问问
- Sorry, what? - Sorry. I was just gonna ask

123
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,432
如果你喜欢三明治的话 没关系
if you like sandwiches. Never mind.

124
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:54,809
你确定你不想要一些吗？
You sure you don't want some?

125
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:56,310
嗯 我没事
Mm, I'm okay.

126
00:07:56,444 --> 00:07:58,346
- 我忘了我已经吃过了 - 嗯
- I forgot I already ate. - Mm.

127
00:08:04,452 --> 00:08:07,955
我不喝咖啡因 因为它会对我产生影响
I don't drink caffeine 'cause it does things to me.

128
00:08:08,723 --> 00:08:11,792
后来布拉德让我开始喝茶 喝花草茶
Then Brad converted me to tea. Herbal tea.

129
00:08:11,926 --> 00:08:14,695
布拉德是我在纽约时爱上的那个男人
Brad was this guy I was in love with back in New York.

130
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:16,597
后来有一天 我发现了所有这些山羊性交视频
Then one day, I found all these goat-fucking videos

131
00:08:16,731 --> 00:08:18,532
- 在他的浏览器历史记录中 - 哇哦
- in his browser history. - Whoa.

132
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,701
我试图让他坦白 但我避免冲突
I tried to get him to confess, but I avoid conflict,

133
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:23,771
所以晚餐时 我会点山羊奶酪作为主菜
so at dinner, I'd order goat cheese on an entrée,

134
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:28,042
或者有一次 当他吮吸我的脖子时 我发出咩咩的声音……
or one time when he was sucking on my neck, I bleated like...

135
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:34,181
看看他会有什么反应 所以 我知道他知道我知道
See how he'd react. So, I know he knew I knew.

136
00:08:34,315 --> 00:08:36,050
也许这就是他和我分手的原因
Maybe that's why he broke up with me.

137
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:37,451
他跟你分手了？
He broke up with you?

138
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:39,453
嗯 他是更好的选择
Mm. He was the better catch.

139
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:43,791
我对 Rocky 的男朋友一无所知
I don't know anything about Rocky's boyfriends.

140
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:46,227
我们并没有真正谈论过这些事情
We didn't really talk about that stuff.

141
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,162
你们谈论了什么内容？
What stuff did you talk about?

142
00:08:49,497 --> 00:08:50,531
袜子
Socks.

143
00:08:51,165 --> 00:08:54,468
- 袜子？- 我所有的袜子都有洞
- Socks? - I get holes in all my socks.

144
00:08:54,602 --> 00:08:57,204
我想这是因为我忘记剪脚趾甲了
I think it's 'cause I forget to cut my toenails.

145
00:08:57,338 --> 00:08:59,673
洛奇认为这是因为我在沃尔玛购物
Rocky thinks it's 'cause I shop at Walmart.

146
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:03,512
那是我们最后一次谈话
That was our last conversation.

147
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,981
对不起
I'm sorry.

148
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:08,349
不是你的错
Not your fault.

149
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,760
那么 你和你哥哥住在一起吗？
So, did you live with your brother?

150
00:09:20,361 --> 00:09:23,164
呃 没有 是的 在大学
Uh, no. Yeah, in college.

151
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:26,667
洛奇女士上了大学 我留在了莫斯科
Mm. Rocky went to college. I stayed in Moscow.

152
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:28,736
莫斯科 爱达荷州？
Moscow, Idaho?

153
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:30,771
你还认识另一个吗？
You know another one?

154
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:33,240
另一个莫斯科？
Another Moscow?

155
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:38,112
我需要离开我妈妈的地下室
I need to get out of my mom's basement.

156
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,281
她开始向我收取租金
She started charging me rent.

157
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,450
嗯 她感觉怎么样？
Hmm. And how's she taking it?

158
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,851
现金
Cash.

159
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,755
她感觉怎么样？
How is she feeling?

160
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:49,457
她是个疯子
She's a nut bucket.

161
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,527
洛奇是她最喜欢的 所以……
Rocky was her favorite, so...

162
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,463
嗯 没人喜欢我
Mm. I'm nobody's favorite.

163
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,533
感觉就像身为双胞胎让我很受困扰
Feel like being a twin kind of fucked me.

164
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,803
你知道 当我还是个孩子的时候 我从来不需要任何人 但是现在……
I never needed anyone else as a kid, you know, but now...

165
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:06,774
感觉我不能和叉子交朋友
feel like I can't make friends with a fork.

166
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:09,710
一周一次、两次是不够的
Once, twice a week's not enough.

167
00:10:09,844 --> 00:10:12,547
我想一直和你在一起 我 我太需要人了
I want to hang out all the time. I'm-I'm too needy.

168
00:10:13,548 --> 00:10:15,316
我讨厌独自做事
I hate doing things alone.

169
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:18,085
做饭、打开邮件、
Cooking meals, opening mail,

170
00:10:18,219 --> 00:10:19,453
- 折叠衣物  - 是的
- folding laundry. - Yeah.

171
00:10:19,588 --> 00:10:21,155
两个人一起的话速度会快很多
So much faster with two people.

172
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,423
对吧？说实话
Right? I mean, honestly,

173
00:10:22,557 --> 00:10:23,757
发明床单的人
whoever invented the fitted sheet

174
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:25,893
应该受到鞭笞 而且不是那种有趣的鞭笞
should be flagellated. And not the fun kind.

175
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:30,297
你懂我的意思
You get me.

176
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:52,820
洛基！
Rocky!

177
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:57,258
好久不见了 你好吗？剪头发了吗？
Long time no see. How are you? Did you get a haircut?

178
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:59,160
哦 嗯 ​​是的
Oh. Uh, yeah.

179
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:00,595
这太随机了
This is so random.

180
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:02,863
前几天我确实在想你
I was literally thinking about you the other day.

181
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:05,634
我读到一篇文章 讲的是日语中有一个词
I was reading an article about how there's a Japanese word

182
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,468
对于那些在公寓里死去的人来说……
for people who die in their apartments...

183
00:11:07,602 --> 00:11:09,436
- 嗯 - ......而且需要很长时间
- Mm. - ...and it takes a long time

184
00:11:09,571 --> 00:11:12,006
任何人找到尸体都需要花费数年的时间
for anyone to find the body-- Years even.

185
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:13,474
大多是老人
Old men mostly.

186
00:11:13,608 --> 00:11:15,876
那里好像有一个大问题
It's like a big problem over there.

187
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,278
啊 太糟糕了
Ah, that's awful.

188
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:18,379
不是吗？
Isn't it?

189
00:11:19,113 --> 00:11:21,048
无论如何 我想你已经知道了
Anyway, I figured you knew this already

190
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:24,151
因为你以前住在东京 对吗？
because you used to live in Tokyo, right?

191
00:11:24,285 --> 00:11:25,319
对 是的
Right. Yeah.

192
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:27,622
是啊 这个词又是什么？
Yeah, what is the word again?

193
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:29,823
哦 呃……
Oh, uh...

194
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,562
“阿什托阿图什 ”
"Ahtoatushi."

195
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,566
这听起来不对
That doesn't sound right.

196
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,928
你好？
Hello?

197
00:12:08,062 --> 00:12:10,397
嘿 我是罗曼
Hey. It's Roman.

198
00:12:10,965 --> 00:12:12,601
你想和我一起去买杂货吗？
Do you wanna get groceries with me?

199
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:24,845
嘿 你怎么知道柠檬是否成熟了？
Hey, how do you know if lemons are ripe?

200
00:12:24,979 --> 00:12:27,281
呃 它是黄色的 未成熟的柠檬是绿色的
Uh, it's yellow. Unripe lemons are green.

201
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:30,417
那么他们为什么会拿出这么多未成熟的苹果呢？
So why do they got so many unripe ones out?

202
00:12:30,552 --> 00:12:33,020
那些是酸橙
Those are limes.

203
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:46,267
呃……
Uh...

204
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:48,536
你还好嗎？
Are you okay?

205
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,739
你能别笑我吗？
Can you not laugh at me?

206
00:12:51,405 --> 00:12:53,941
我知道我不是最聪明的人
I know I'm not, like, the brightest tool in the shed,

207
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:56,477
但是...我并不欣赏
but... I don't appreciate it.

208
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,480
是的 是的 当然 对不起
Yeah. Yeah, of course. I'm sorry.

209
00:12:59,614 --> 00:13:02,149
你知道 如果我错了...请告诉我
You know, if I get something wrong... tell me.

210
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:05,052
因为...这样我就能更了解情况了
'Cause... then I can know better.

211
00:13:09,123 --> 00:13:10,592
现在是时候指出
Would now be a good time to point out

212
00:13:10,725 --> 00:13:12,993
我想你的意思是“棚子里最锋利的工具？”
I think you meant to say, "sharpest tool in the shed?"

213
00:13:16,765 --> 00:13:18,432
是的
Yeah.

214
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:22,436
也许你的意思是“盒子里最亮的灯泡”
Maybe you meant to say, "brightest bulb in the box."

215
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,104
- 是的 也许这就是我的意思 - 是的 是的
- Yeah, maybe that's what I meant. - Yeah, yeah.

216
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:04,945
嘿
Hey.

217
00:14:06,781 --> 00:14:08,148
呃 抱歉
Uh, sorry.

218
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:11,051
我最近睡得不好 所以...
I haven't been sleeping well, so...

219
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:12,386
哦
Oh.

220
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,154
嘿 那是洛奇的衬衫吗？
Hey, is that Rocky's shirt?

221
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:16,890
哦 是啊 是啊 你怎么知道的？
Oh, yeah, yeah. How'd you know?

222
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:18,727
- 你穿起来很好看 - 谢谢
- Looks good on you. - Thanks.

223
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:21,862
呃 我们在寻找什么？
What, uh, what are we looking for?

224
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:24,965
哦 只是随便看看 我选书都是看封面的
Oh, just browsing. I pick books based on the cover.

225
00:14:25,633 --> 00:14:27,234
我认为你不应该这么做
I thought you weren't supposed to do that.

226
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:29,804
你也不该把棉签塞进耳朵里
You're also not supposed to put Q-tips in your ear,

227
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:32,406
但如果你做得对 感觉就会非常好
but if you do it right, it feels really good.

228
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:02,970
我不知道我为什么要这么做
I don't know why I'm doing this

229
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:04,471
因为没人会听到它
'cause nobody's ever gonna hear it.

230
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,241
我曾经接过一个陌生号码的电话
I answered a call from an unknown number once,

231
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:10,377
他说 “嘿 我在想你 ”
and he said, "Hey, I was thinking about you."

232
00:15:10,545 --> 00:15:11,780
“你今晚要做什么？”
"What are you doing tonight?"

233
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:13,581
我们烤了……
And we baked...

234
00:15:14,582 --> 00:15:15,784
嘿
Hey.

235
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:19,153
我想我会留下来
Think I'm gonna stay.

236
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:21,455
- 什么？ - 是啊 律师说
- What? - Yeah. Lawyer says,

237
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:23,792
无论如何 遗嘱认证都需要一些时间
the probate's gonna take a little while anyway.

238
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:26,059
此外 Rocky 的老板还给我提供了一份工作
Plus, Rocky's boss offered me a job.

239
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:29,463
呃 他哭了很多 但我认为他是认真的
Uh, he was crying a lot, but I think he was serious.

240
00:15:29,597 --> 00:15:30,565
唔
Hmm.

241
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:34,101
感觉我现在就需要待在这里
Feel like I need to be here right now.

242
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:35,969
完全
Totally.

243
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:37,070
是的
Yeah.

244
00:15:37,739 --> 00:15:40,407
所以 我想这意味着你和我可以成为买菜的好朋友了
So, I guess that means you and I get to be grocery buddies.

245
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,077
嘿 你的语音信箱问候语怎么了？
Hey, what's up with your voicemail greeting,

246
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:45,446
顺便一提？
by the way?

247
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,648
再来一个
One more.

248
00:15:46,781 --> 00:15:48,616
好的 准备好了吗？
Okay, ready?

249
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:52,887
你好

提示音后

253
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:04,331
毛茸茸的兔子！
Fluffy bunny!

254
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,510
你在想什么？
What are you thinking about?

255
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:21,315
你相信死刑吗？
Do you believe in the death penalty?

256
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:23,150
这就是你所想的吗？
That's what you were thinking about?

257
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:28,857
我想不会 因为有可能
I guess no. Because there's a chance

258
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:33,093
处决无辜者 并且死亡是不可挽回的
of executing someone innocent, and death is irrevocable.

259
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:37,464
是的 但有些事情是无法挽回的
Yeah, but there's some things you can't take back.

260
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,669
真的
True.

261
00:16:46,741 --> 00:16:48,843
你做过的最糟糕的事情是什么？
What's the worst thing you've ever done?

262
00:16:52,981 --> 00:16:55,148
你做过的最糟糕的事情是什么？
What's the worst thing you've ever done?

263
00:16:55,984 --> 00:16:57,284
有几个
There's a few.

264
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,388
毫米
Mm.

265
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,462
就这一次...
This one time...

266
00:17:10,097 --> 00:17:12,065
洛基和我 呃……
Rocky and I, uh...

267
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:15,235
我们当时16岁
we were 16.

268
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,073
还有 嗯...
And, um...

269
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:23,410
他的死都是我的错
It was my fault he died.

270
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,650
- 什么？- 这是我的错
- What? - It was my fault.

271
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:34,488
迪恩应该去机场接我
Dean was supposed to pick me up from the airport.

272
00:17:35,489 --> 00:17:36,691
但他忘了
But he forgot.

273
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:41,194
我本来可以叫辆出租车
And I could've just called a cab,

274
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:43,397
但我希望他能来接我
but I wanted him to pick me up,

275
00:17:43,531 --> 00:17:46,834
所以我一次又一次地给他打电话
so I called him again and again and again,

276
00:17:46,968 --> 00:17:48,736
而我却毫不留情
and I was relentless.

277
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:51,039
因此 他超速了
So, he broke the speed limit.

278
00:17:52,006 --> 00:17:53,541
你可以猜到这是怎么回事
And you can guess where this is going.

279
00:17:53,675 --> 00:17:55,777
他撞车了
He crashed.

280
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,714
我对他说的最后一句话是……
My last words to him were...

281
00:18:01,348 --> 00:18:02,784
“去你的 ”
"Fuck you."

282
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:05,954
所以...这就是我的故事
So... that's my story.

283
00:18:06,654 --> 00:18:07,689
一...
Um...

284
00:18:09,991 --> 00:18:13,528
五年级的时候 我的左眼长了麦粒肿
In fifth grade, I had a stye in my left eye.

285
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:17,431
在学校拍照日 那是……
On school picture day. It was...

286
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:20,100
又肿又红
swollen and red.

287
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:22,937
我看起来像福里斯特·惠特克
And I looked like Forest Whitaker.

288
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,740
所以 我恳求待在家里
So, I begged to stay home.

289
00:18:27,709 --> 00:18:29,077
但我被否决了
But I was overruled,

290
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:33,280
所以 Dean 在年鉴里假扮了我
so Dean pretended to be me for the yearbook.

291
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:37,752
他救了我 嗯……
He saved me. Um...

292
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:41,556
每当遇到困难时 他总会在我身边
He was always there on the bad days.

293
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,559
当街上的阿什利 呃
When Ashley from down the street, uh,

294
00:18:44,692 --> 00:18:47,762
他取笑我的粉色铅笔盒 称她为黄油巨魔
made fun of my pink pencil box, he called her a butter troll.

295
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:53,968
呃 当我的继父让我不要再回家时
Uh, when my stepfather asked me not to come home anymore,

296
00:18:54,969 --> 00:18:56,470
迪恩握住我的手
Dean held my hand.

297
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:00,775
感觉就像 呃...
Feels like, uh...

298
00:19:02,076 --> 00:19:03,845
现在每天都是糟糕的一天
every day's a bad day now.

299
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,416
嗯 对不起 呃……
Um, sorry, uh...

300
00:19:10,718 --> 00:19:14,856
好疼 嗯 真的好疼
It hurts. Like, um, it's literally painful.

301
00:19:15,957 --> 00:19:18,191
但我喜欢它 因为
But I like it because

302
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,928
如果我没有痛苦 那么……
if I don't have the pain, then...

303
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:23,698
他真的走了
he's really gone.

304
00:19:24,966 --> 00:19:27,035
而我实际上是孤独的
And I'm actually alone.

305
00:20:49,717 --> 00:20:50,852
打扰一下
Excuse me.

我的父亲带走了我的双胞胎兄弟

399
00:24:59,233 --> 00:25:00,835
他们从不想让我们见面
and they never wanted us to meet,

400
00:25:00,968 --> 00:25:02,336
这就是为什么

我从未被允许去日本探望他

嗯 也许吧
Mm, maybe.

我不知道 我想

他们说我们生来孤独
They say we're born alone,

407
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:22,056
但是...对于双胞胎来说 情况并非如此

408
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,892

You have a built-in best friend.

409
00:25:28,295 --> 00:25:30,364
不 双胞胎也会感到孤独
No, twins can get lonely too.

410
00:25:31,332 --> 00:25:33,000
我感到无比孤独
I'm incredibly lonely.

411
00:25:33,134 --> 00:25:35,536
嗯嗯 你这么说只是为了让我感觉好一点
Mm-mm. You're just saying that to make me feel better

412
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:37,671
- 关于我自己 - 我不是 我是认真的
- about myself. - I'm not. I mean it.

413
00:25:37,805 --> 00:25:38,873
我是认真的
I mean it.

414
00:25:40,975 --> 00:25:43,310
我非常擅长...
I'm very adept at...

415
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:46,515
与其他人分享我自己
sharing myself with other people.

416
00:25:48,282 --> 00:25:50,017
但有时我会感到力不从心
But sometimes I can run empty.

417
00:25:52,186 --> 00:25:53,387
因为...
Because...

418
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:59,727
我总是付出 却很少得到
I'm always giving and not so much receiving.

419
00:26:00,694 --> 00:26:02,430
对于罗曼来说 这是五五开
With Roman, it's fifty-fifty.

420
00:26:03,064 --> 00:26:04,665
嗯 确实如此 我的意思是 我们……
Well, it was. I mean, we...

421
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,868
我们现在已经不怎么说话了
we don't really talk that much anymore.

422
00:26:08,402 --> 00:26:09,737
发生了什么？
What happened?

423
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,038
只是生活
Just life.

424
00:26:13,307 --> 00:26:16,243
显然 在成长过程中 我们是形影不离的 但是……
Growing up, we were attached by the hip, obviously, but...

425
00:26:21,348 --> 00:26:24,218
现在我们非常不同了
We're very different... now.

426
00:26:25,086 --> 00:26:26,387
我认为那是...
And I think that's...

427
00:26:27,855 --> 00:26:29,590
我认为这对他来说更难
I think it's harder for him.

428
00:26:31,258 --> 00:26:34,462
有一张我们小时候的照片 照片上我们穿着
There's a photo of us as kids where we're wearing

429
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:38,567
这些配套的睡衣 直到今天
these matching pajamas, and to this day,

430
00:26:38,699 --> 00:26:42,236
我无法告诉你照片中的我是哪一个
I could not tell you which one I am in the picture.

431
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:43,538
这太疯狂了
It's crazy.

432
00:26:44,872 --> 00:26:46,073
我是“我们”
I was "We."

433
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,609
现在 我就是“我”
And now, I'm "I."

434
00:26:50,244 --> 00:26:51,546
你想念他
You miss him.

435
00:26:52,046 --> 00:26:53,582
非常
Very much.

436
00:27:00,354 --> 00:27:01,889
他是我最喜欢的人
He's my favorite person.

437
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:06,494
他认为我是好双胞胎 但事实是他
He thinks I'm the good twin, but it's him.

438
00:27:08,597 --> 00:27:10,464
当我们还很小的时候 我……
When we were really little, I...

439
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:13,334
有一次我上楼梯时摔断了大脚趾
I broke my big toe tripping up the stairs one time,

440
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:16,303
当天晚些时候
and later that same day,

441
00:27:16,437 --> 00:27:20,674
罗曼回家后脚骨折了
Roman comes home and has a broken foot.

442
00:27:22,209 --> 00:27:25,079
他不想让我独自承受痛苦
He didn't want me to be in pain by myself.

443
00:27:25,212 --> 00:27:27,648
哦 天哪 太可爱了
Oh. Oh, my God, that's adorable.

444
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:29,416
他可能 就像 丢了一个保龄球
He probably, like, dropped a bowling ball

445
00:27:29,551 --> 00:27:30,484
在上面或某物上
on it or something.

446
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:31,952
-天哪 -我知道
- My God. - I know.

447
00:27:37,124 --> 00:27:38,759
我从来没有骨折过
I've never broken a bone.

448
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:42,363
哦 不 现在 它就要发生了
Oh, no. Now, it's gonna happen.

449
00:27:42,496 --> 00:27:44,365
就像一个东西 你不能这么说
It's like a thing. You can't say that.

450
00:27:44,498 --> 00:27:45,466
好的
Okay.

451
00:27:49,504 --> 00:27:50,838
你应该给他打电话
You should call him.

452
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,543
是的 我应该
Yeah, I should.

453
00:27:54,675 --> 00:27:56,110
你应该给他打电话 我会听的
You should call him and I'll listen.

454
00:27:56,243 --> 00:27:57,378
噢 天哪
Oh, Jesus.

455
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:00,848
抱住你的河马
Hold your hippos.

456
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:03,684
不 我不能
No, I can't.

457
00:28:03,817 --> 00:28:06,020
我必须修复你们破裂的双胞胎关系
I must amend your broken twinship.

458
00:28:06,153 --> 00:28:08,189
我一生都在等待这一刻
My whole life has been waiting for this moment.

459
00:28:11,192 --> 00:28:12,693
你真贴心
You're really sweet.

460
00:28:17,632 --> 00:28:19,333
我认为你会是一个很好的双胞胎
I think you'd be a good twin.

461
00:28:38,953 --> 00:28:40,988
我爱上你了
I'm falling in love with you.

462
00:28:44,158 --> 00:28:45,359
我听到了
I heard that.

463
00:29:05,846 --> 00:29:08,949
我喜欢 OM 的这种字体
I like this font for the OM.

464
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:11,218
呃 龙虾？你快要把我杀了
Ugh, lobster? You're killing me.

465
00:29:11,752 --> 00:29:13,821
这对血汗工厂的工人来说是一种冒犯
That's offensive to sweatshop workers,

466
00:29:13,954 --> 00:29:15,122
你不觉得吗？
don't you think?

467
00:29:16,257 --> 00:29:18,359
嘿 我可以问你一个私人问题吗？
Hey, can I ask you a personal question?

468
00:29:18,892 --> 00:29:21,962
我不太喜欢在工作中谈论我的个人生活
I don't really like to talk about my personal life at work.

469
00:29:22,096 --> 00:29:24,131
嗯 这是关于我的个人生活
Well, it's about my personal life.

470
00:29:25,065 --> 00:29:26,800
当然可以
Sure, that's fine.

471
00:29:26,934 --> 00:29:28,435
我和一个男人度过了一个美妙的约会
So I had this amazing date with a guy,

472
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,404
我们都喜欢美味的三明治
and we both like really good sandwiches,

473
00:29:30,538 --> 00:29:32,806
所以我周一给他发了短信 “晚餐吃三明治吗？”
so I texted him on Monday, "Sandwiches for dinner?"

474
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,075
“明天、星期三、星期四或星期五怎么样？”
"How's tomorrow or Wednesday or Thursday or Friday?"

475
00:29:35,209 --> 00:29:36,645
他没有回应
And he didn't respond.

476
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:38,747
太糟糕了
That's too bad.

477
00:29:38,879 --> 00:29:40,781
- 进入下一个  - 嗯 我还没说完
- Onto the next. - Well, I'm not done.

478
00:29:40,914 --> 00:29:42,449
所以我在周二跟进了他的情况
So I followed up with him on Tuesday,

479
00:29:42,584 --> 00:29:44,653
“实际上 星期四不行” 尽管我可以
"Actually, can't do Thursday," even though I could.

480
00:29:44,785 --> 00:29:47,454
“明天怎么样 也就是星期三或星期五？”
"How's tomorrow, aka Wednesday or Friday?"

481
00:29:47,589 --> 00:29:48,822
附言：你今天过得怎么样？”
PS, how was your day?"

482
00:29:48,956 --> 00:29:50,592
什么也没有
And nothing.

483
00:29:50,725 --> 00:29:52,560
您认为我应该等多久才能再次给他发短信？
How long do you think I should wait before I text him again?

484
00:29:52,694 --> 00:29:54,596
别再给他发短信了
Never text him again.

485
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:57,097
他不喜欢你
He doesn't like you.

486
00:29:58,465 --> 00:29:59,433
毫米
Mm.

487
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:01,068
你好 丹尼斯
Hi, Dennis.

488
00:30:01,201 --> 00:30:02,903
- 嘿 玛西 - 你今天过得怎么样？
- Hey, Marcie. - How's your day going?

489
00:30:03,037 --> 00:30:04,471
呃 好吧 我可以问你吗？
Ugh, well. Can I ask you

490
00:30:04,606 --> 00:30:05,774
- 一个个人问题？ - 嗯
- a personal question? - Mm-hmm.

491
00:30:05,906 --> 00:30:07,509
你能连续发多少条短信
How many consecutive texts can you send

492
00:30:07,642 --> 00:30:09,276
在你不再尊重自己之前 你会对潜在的灵魂伴侣抱有怎样的态度？
to a potential soulmate before you stop respecting yourself?

493
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:11,780
- 我已经五点了  - 他还没回应吗？
- I'm at five. - And he hasn't responded?

494
00:30:11,912 --> 00:30:13,748
没有 我们度过了有史以来最美好的约会
No. And we had the best date ever.

495
00:30:13,881 --> 00:30:15,282
清醒八小时 睡眠四小时
Eight hours awake and four hours asleep.

496
00:30:15,416 --> 00:30:16,850
我不明白 他是不是在敷衍我？
I don't understand. Is he blowing me off?

497
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:19,353
不 这太傻了 为什么有人会忽略你？
No, that's silly. Why would anyone ignore you?

498
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:20,689
你真是个好人
You're such a great guy.

499
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:23,157
也许他只是真的很忙
Maybe he's just really busy.

500
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,992
有时电话很忙的时候
Sometimes when the phones are really busy,

501
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:27,796
我忘记回复事情 直到几天后才回复
I forget to reply to things until days later.

502
00:30:27,928 --> 00:30:29,531
我想有些人会忘记你对他们有多重要
I think some people forget how much you mean to them

503
00:30:29,664 --> 00:30:30,998
直到他们看到你的脸 你知道吗？
until they see your face, you know?

504
00:30:31,131 --> 00:30:32,667
仿佛眼不见 心不烦
Like out of sight, out of mind.

505
00:30:32,801 --> 00:30:34,703
我有点想出现在他家门口
I kind of just wanna show up at his door,

506
00:30:34,835 --> 00:30:36,170
就像卡罗尔·金的那首歌
like that Carole King song.

507
00:30:36,303 --> 00:30:37,438
这很浪漫吧？
That's romantic, right?

508
00:30:37,971 --> 00:30:40,542
或许吧 有可能 是的
Maybe. It could be. Yeah.

509
00:30:41,141 --> 00:30:42,610
我的意思是 你比我更了解他
I mean, you know him better than I do,

510
00:30:42,744 --> 00:30:43,944
所以我说 跟着你的直觉走吧
so I say go with your gut.

511
00:30:44,078 --> 00:30:45,379
你说得太对了
You're so right.

512
00:30:45,513 --> 00:30:47,281
我知道你就是我要问的人
I knew you were the person to ask.

513
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,218
接待
Reception.

514
00:30:54,922 --> 00:30:56,023
你好？
Hello?

515
00:30:56,691 --> 00:30:57,991
UPS
UPS.

516
00:30:58,158 --> 00:30:59,860
哦好的
Oh, okay.

517
00:31:13,941 --> 00:31:15,376
- 来吧 - 好的
- Come on. - Okay.

518
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:18,245
我跟不上这个戏了
I can't keep up with this drama.

519
00:31:28,723 --> 00:31:29,824
- 真的吗？ - 是的
- Is it really? - Yeah.

520
00:31:29,957 --> 00:31:31,191
你是认真的？
Are you serious?

521
00:31:32,126 --> 00:31:33,327
耶稣基督
Jesus Christ.

522
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,890
我正在路過這裡！
I'm traversing here!

523
00:32:02,022 --> 00:32:03,591
-我一直想这么说 -等等
- I've always wanted to say that. - Wait,

524
00:32:03,725 --> 00:32:05,794
太性感了
that was so sexy.

525
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,100
洛基！
Rocky!

526
00:32:14,234 --> 00:32:16,036
去你的！
Fuck you!

527
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,772
你认识那家伙吗？
Do you know that guy?

528
00:32:17,906 --> 00:32:19,641
是的 给我两分钟
Yeah. Give me two minutes.

529
00:32:22,744 --> 00:32:23,778
你好

没人会听到这个 嗯……
Nobody's ever gonna hear this. Um...

544
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:14,354
我曾经接过一个陌生号码的电话
I answered a call from an unknown number once,

545
00:34:14,522 --> 00:34:17,525
他说 “嘿 我在想你
and he said, "Hey, I was thinking about you.

546
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:19,059
你今晚要做什么？”
What are you doing tonight?"

547
00:34:19,827 --> 00:34:23,397
我们还烤了一个草莓奶油蛋糕
And we baked a strawberry shortcake.

548
00:34:25,934 --> 00:34:27,234
早上
And in the morning,

549
00:34:27,401 --> 00:34:28,870
我去寻找另一片
I went looking for another slice.

550
00:34:30,705 --> 00:34:32,740
我忘了这只是一个梦
I forgot it was just a dream.

551
00:35:13,748 --> 00:35:15,049
我们不咬人
We don't bite.

552
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,987
哦 抱歉 我想我迷路了
Oh, sorry. I think I'm lost.

553
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,387
我明白
I understand.

554
00:35:21,089 --> 00:35:23,091
只要你愿意 你就可以听
You can just listen if you want.

555
00:35:25,793 --> 00:35:27,427
你的双胞胎兄弟叫什么名字？
What's your twin's name?

556
00:35:34,102 --> 00:35:36,604
当我们还是孩子的时候 洛奇很怕黑
Rocky was scared of the dark when we were kids.

557
00:35:38,539 --> 00:35:39,941
我们有双层床
We had bunk beds,

558
00:35:40,742 --> 00:35:44,579
但我和他总是共用上铺
but me and him would always share the top bunk.

559
00:35:46,146 --> 00:35:48,181
所以 怪物无法抓住他
So, the monsters couldn't get him.

560
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,656
后来有一天晚上 他说他不害怕
Then one night, he said that he wasn't afraid.

561
00:35:56,057 --> 00:35:58,325
而我才是那个害怕的人
And that I was the one who was afraid.

562
00:35:59,459 --> 00:36:00,828
真他妈让我生气
Fucking pissed me off.

563
00:36:02,462 --> 00:36:03,430
呃……
Uh...

564
00:36:04,065 --> 00:36:06,534
我们可能年纪太大了 不适合同床共枕了
We were probably too old to be sharing a bed

565
00:36:06,668 --> 00:36:08,368
无论如何 在那时
at that point, anyway.

566
00:36:11,572 --> 00:36:14,776
我不知道——我不知道我为什么要讲这个故事
I don't-- I don't know why I was telling that story.

567
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,387
- 嗨 丹尼斯！ - 哦 操我！
- Hi, Dennis! - Oh, fuck me!

568
00:37:00,521 --> 00:37:03,057
噢 对不起 我不是故意吓你的
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.

569
00:37:03,191 --> 00:37:04,424
我以为我是最后一个来这里的人
I thought I was the last one here.

570
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:05,993
你还在工作吗？
Are you still working?

571
00:37:06,127 --> 00:37:07,862
不 我正在学习
No, I'm studying.

572
00:37:08,563 --> 00:37:09,731
对于 LSAT
For the LSAT.

573
00:37:10,531 --> 00:37:12,533
我不知道你想成为一名律师
I didn't know you wanted to be a lawyer.

574
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:14,602
太酷了！哇！
That's so cool! Wow!

575
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:19,841
好的 祝你晚安
Okay, well, have a good night.

576
00:37:19,974 --> 00:37:23,711
好的！再见 丹尼斯 哦 祝你好运
Okay! Bye, Dennis. Oh, and good luck.

577
00:37:40,061 --> 00:37:41,662
- 喂？- 嘿
- Hello? - Hey.

578
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:43,531
是羅曼
It's Roman.

579
00:37:43,664 --> 00:37:44,565
嘿
Hey.

580
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:46,801
你想和我一起去买杂货吗？
You wanna get groceries with me?

581
00:37:47,535 --> 00:37:51,038
是啊！我一直想去商店
Yeah! I've been, um, meaning to go to the store.

582
00:38:44,491 --> 00:38:45,693
洛基！
Rocky!

583
00:38:47,228 --> 00:38:49,864
哦 哇 你……
Oh. Wow. You...

584
00:38:49,997 --> 00:38:52,633
抱歉 你一定是 Rocky 的兄弟吧？
Sorry, you must be Rocky's brother?

585
00:38:52,767 --> 00:38:54,802
是的 是的
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

586
00:38:54,936 --> 00:38:57,171
嗯 我对你的损失深感抱歉
Um, I'm so sorry for your loss.

587
00:38:57,305 --> 00:38:59,974
谢谢 你当时在仪式现场吗？还是……
Thanks. Were you at the service or...

588
00:39:00,107 --> 00:39:02,777
不 我去塔希提岛是为了工作
No, I was-- I was in Tahiti, for work.

589
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:06,514
呃 但是他去世的时候我在场
Uh, but I was-- I was there when he died.

590
00:39:06,647 --> 00:39:08,316
噢 你就是那个人
Oh, you're that guy.

591
00:39:08,448 --> 00:39:10,017
我们只是想买点冻酸奶
We were just trying to get some froyo,

592
00:39:10,151 --> 00:39:13,888
然后这个疯子就开始对我们尖叫
and this crazy fucking lunatic, like, starts screaming at us.

593
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:15,590
于是 洛奇走上街头
And so, Rocky stepped into the street,

594
00:39:15,723 --> 00:39:17,692
然后这辆车突然从天而降
and this car came out of, like, nowhere,

595
00:39:17,825 --> 00:39:19,392
我听到了嘎吱嘎吱的声音
and I heard this crunching sound.

596
00:39:19,527 --> 00:39:22,129
哇 嗯 你没必要听这些
Wow. Um, you don't need to hear all that.

597
00:39:22,263 --> 00:39:25,299
抱歉 我正在更换治疗师
I'm sorry. I'm in the process of switching therapists.

598
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:29,136
你看到那个疯狂尖叫的家伙了吗？或者......
Did you get a look at the crazy screaming guy or...

599
00:39:30,437 --> 00:39:33,473
说实话 我没法告诉你 事情发生得太快了
I couldn't tell you, honestly. It just-- It happened so fast.

600
00:39:33,608 --> 00:39:35,343
呃 我没能仔细看清他
Uh, I didn't get a good look at him.

601
00:39:35,475 --> 00:39:38,312
哦 我刚刚想了很多
Oh. I've just, uh, thought a lot about

602
00:39:38,445 --> 00:39:41,048
如果我见到他我会对他做什么
what I would do to that guy if I ever saw him.

603
00:39:42,516 --> 00:39:44,886
把他的睾丸从喉咙里扯出来
Rip his fucking testicles right out of his throat,

604
00:39:45,019 --> 00:39:47,221
把它们从他自己的阴茎洞里塞回去
shove them back down through his own dick hole,

605
00:39:47,355 --> 00:39:48,623
退出他的屁股
back out his ass.

606
00:39:49,357 --> 00:39:52,392
狠狠地打他的脸 直到他失去生命为止
Pummel his fucking face till he was past his expiration date.

607
00:39:56,631 --> 00:39:58,099
嗨 抱歉 我没有——
Hi. I'm sorry. I didn't--

608
00:39:58,232 --> 00:40:00,668
我不是故意打断你们的谈话
I didn't mean to interrupt your conversation,

609
00:40:00,801 --> 00:40:02,570
但是 嗯...哦！
but, um... Oh!

610
00:40:03,571 --> 00:40:04,839
我知道你？
Do I know you?

611
00:40:06,173 --> 00:40:08,009
不 对不起 我是鲁珀特
No, sorry. I'm-I'm Rupert.

612
00:40:08,142 --> 00:40:10,177
- 我刚从伦敦来拜访  - 哦
- I'm just visiting from London. - Oh.

613
00:40:10,311 --> 00:40:11,846
但事实上 这种事经常发生在我身上
But it happens to me all the time, actually.

614
00:40:11,979 --> 00:40:14,081
总是这样 我总是这么说
One of those faces. All the time. I always say that.

615
00:40:14,215 --> 00:40:16,017
好的 嗯 一定是这样
Okay. Well, that must be,

616
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,218
那一定非常棒
that must be very nice.

617
00:40:17,351 --> 00:40:18,686
不管怎样 我只是想说“嗨”
Anyway, I just wanted to say "Hi,"

618
00:40:18,819 --> 00:40:21,188
嗯 抱歉 有点尴尬
and, um, sorry this was awkward,

619
00:40:21,322 --> 00:40:23,024
但是 是的 我表示哀悼
but, yeah, my condolences.

620
00:40:23,157 --> 00:40:24,959
- 再见 鲁珀特 - 谢谢
- Bye, Rupert. - Thanks.

621
00:40:25,893 --> 00:40:26,961
祝你一切顺利
Have a good one.

622
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:30,965
那到底是什么？
What the hell was that?

623
00:40:31,565 --> 00:40:33,466
我开始用不同的口音说话
I start talking in different accents

624
00:40:33,601 --> 00:40:35,435
当我发现某人有吸引力时
when I find someone attractive.

625
00:40:36,003 --> 00:40:37,305
这是一种防御机制
It's a defense mechanism.

626
00:40:38,205 --> 00:40:39,439
等等 妈的
Wait, shit.

627
00:40:39,573 --> 00:40:40,741
- 让我去把他带回来  - 不！
- Let me go get him back. - No!

628
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:44,578
那么他是你喜欢的类型吗？
So was he your type?

629
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:45,947
呃……
Uh...

630
00:40:47,248 --> 00:40:49,250
我觉得我没有那种类型
I don't think I have a type.

631
00:40:51,852 --> 00:40:53,554
你知道吗 工作中有一个同性恋者
You know, there's a gay guy at work.

632
00:40:53,688 --> 00:40:54,755
独自的
Sam.

633
00:40:55,556 --> 00:40:57,992
你应该见见他 我觉得你们会相处得很好
You should meet him. I think you'd really get along.

634
00:40:58,693 --> 00:41:00,394
你知道 这就像是 “你们都是亚洲人
You know, that's sort of like, "You're both Asian.

635
00:41:00,528 --> 00:41:02,330
我确信你们有很多关于亚洲的事情要谈 ”
I'm sure you have lots of Asian things to talk about."

636
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:04,231
不 伙计 我只是想帮你牵线搭桥
No, man, I'm trying to hook you up.

637
00:41:04,799 --> 00:41:05,900
快点
Come on.

638
00:41:07,902 --> 00:41:09,437
你喜欢什么类型的女孩？
What kind of girls are you into?

639
00:41:11,872 --> 00:41:13,941
我喜欢胸部
I like boobs.

640
00:41:14,775 --> 00:41:17,611
但说实话 此时此刻 我只想认识一个好女孩
But honestly, at this point, I just wanna meet a nice girl.

641
00:41:18,245 --> 00:41:19,680
好女孩没有胸部吗？
Nice girls don't have boobs?

642
00:41:21,248 --> 00:41:22,783
如果你找到了 请告诉我
If you find one, let me know.

643
00:41:23,284 --> 00:41:24,585
一起还是分开？
Together or separate?

644
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:26,187
- 一起  - 分开
- Together. - Separate.

645
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,961
这该死的灯为什么亮着？
Why is this fucking light on?

646
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,370
我的个人生活！
my personal life!

647
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,016
- 嗨 丹尼斯  - 嗯 嗨 玛西
- Hi, Dennis. - Mm, hi, Marcie.

648
00:41:55,149 --> 00:41:57,718
- 你看起来真的很开心 - 嗯 谢谢
- You look really happy. - Mm, thanks.

649
00:41:58,419 --> 00:42:01,856
- 我很高兴 - 太棒了！真为你高兴
- I am happy. - That's amazing! Good for you.

650
00:42:01,989 --> 00:42:05,326
是的 我这周末要去西雅图看一场冰球比赛
Yeah. I'm going to Seattle this weekend for a hockey game.

651
00:42:05,459 --> 00:42:08,796
啊 太令人兴奋了 我喜欢冬季运动
Ah, how exciting. I love winter sports.

652
00:42:08,929 --> 00:42:10,197
这是我内心的密歇根
It's the Michigan in me.

653
00:42:10,798 --> 00:42:12,400
是的 对我来说有点睾丸激素味
Yeah, it's a bit testosterone-y for my taste,

654
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:13,667
但罗曼对此很感兴趣
but Roman's into it,

655
00:42:13,801 --> 00:42:15,669
而人际关系则关乎妥协
and relationships are about compromise.

656
00:42:15,803 --> 00:42:17,738
哦！罗曼是谁？
Ooh! Who's Roman?

657
00:42:17,872 --> 00:42:19,240
他是你的男朋友吗？
Is he your boyfriend?

658
00:42:19,373 --> 00:42:22,810
不 嗯 我们只是朋友
No. Um, we're just pals.

659
00:42:23,711 --> 00:42:25,546
- 那真是太好了 - 是的
- That's really nice. - Yeah.

660
00:42:26,981 --> 00:42:30,184
- 你结婚了吗？ - 我？
- Are you married? - Me?

661
00:42:30,317 --> 00:42:32,920
不 嗯 你以为我结婚了吗？
No. Um, did you think I was married?

662
00:42:34,388 --> 00:42:35,723
是的 你看起来就像某个人
Yeah, you just seem like someone

663
00:42:35,856 --> 00:42:37,058
到你这个年纪就会结婚
who would be married by your age.

664
00:42:37,658 --> 00:42:39,326
你这么说真有趣 因为所有的女人
It's funny you say that, because all the women

665
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,895
我家里的人结婚都很早
in my family married very young,

666
00:42:41,028 --> 00:42:42,196
我一直认为
and I always thought

667
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:44,498
我会在28岁之前生一个孩子
I would have a kid before I turned 28.

668
00:42:44,632 --> 00:42:46,567
当然 现在也有一些进步
And sure, these days, there are advancements,

669
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:49,336
但时间仍在流逝
but the clock is still ticking.

670
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:50,539
为了我的鸡蛋
For my eggs.

671
00:42:53,674 --> 00:42:55,109
好的 好吧 我要去买更多的蛋糕
Right, well, I'm gonna get more cake.

672
00:42:55,242 --> 00:42:56,911
好的 我就站在这里
Okay. I'll just stand here.

673
00:44:05,614 --> 00:44:07,414
她问我是否想吃甜筒冰淇淋
So she asked if I want an ice cream cone,

674
00:44:07,549 --> 00:44:09,917
我说：“好的 但是我想在里面放点冰淇淋 ”
and I said, "Yes, but I would like ice cream in it."

675
00:44:11,285 --> 00:44:12,453
- 啊 - 什么？
- Ah. - What?

676
00:44:12,587 --> 00:44:14,255
没什么 我的狗下巴让我很不舒服
Nothing. My dog jaw's bothering me.

677
00:44:14,388 --> 00:44:15,489
- 你的狗下巴？ - 是的
- Your dog jaw? - Yeah.

678
00:44:15,624 --> 00:44:17,324
- 你没听说过狗下巴吗？ - 没有
- You never heard of dog jaw? - No.

679
00:44:17,458 --> 00:44:18,993
就像我生来就有下颌骨
It's like I was born with a jawbone

680
00:44:19,126 --> 00:44:20,661
形状像爪印
that's shaped like a paw print.

681
00:44:20,794 --> 00:44:21,929
- 什么？- 这里 是的 你就在这里能感觉到
- What? - Here. Yeah, you can feel it right here.

682
00:44:22,062 --> 00:44:23,464
- 在这儿？ - 是的
- Here? - Yeah.

683
00:44:23,598 --> 00:44:24,965
同性恋者
Faggots.

684
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:26,535
等等 你说什么？
Wait, what'd you say?

685
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:29,436
- 没事的 算了 - 嘿！你说什么？
- It's fine. Let it go. - Hey! Fuck did you say?

686
00:44:32,106 --> 00:44:33,674
我说：“看看那些同性恋 ”
I said, "Look at those faggots."

687
00:44:34,643 --> 00:44:35,776
你为什么不道歉？
Why don't you apologize?

688
00:44:36,844 --> 00:44:38,479
嘿 你为什么不吮吸我的鸡巴？
Hey, why don't you suck my dick?

689
00:44:40,014 --> 00:44:41,448
好吧 我会吮吸任何人的鸡巴
Okay, I will suck whosever dick

690
00:44:41,583 --> 00:44:43,884
如果我们能够缓和局势
if we can just de-escalate the situation.

691
00:44:44,018 --> 00:44:45,452
你应该听你女朋友的话
You should listen to your girlfriend.

692
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,121
说声对不起
Say you're sorry.

693
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,994
对不起
I'm sorry.

694
00:44:59,601 --> 00:45:02,303
去你的！
Fuck you!

695
00:45:02,436 --> 00:45:05,372
哦 这里有一个 哦！
Oh. There's one here. Oh!

696
00:45:07,542 --> 00:45:08,876
哦 不 我不喜欢这个
Oh, no. I don't like this.

697
00:45:09,009 --> 00:45:11,212
哦 哦 什么？哎哟！
Oh, oh, what? Ow!

698
00:45:11,345 --> 00:45:12,681
过来 你这个小混蛋
Come here, you little fucking piece

699
00:45:12,813 --> 00:45:16,083
屎！
of shit!

700
00:45:16,217 --> 00:45:17,718
羅馬
Roman.

701
00:45:17,851 --> 00:45:19,353
羅馬 羅馬
Roman. Roman.

702
00:45:19,486 --> 00:45:21,388
罗曼 罗曼 罗曼！停 停 停！
Roman, Roman, Roman! Stop, stop, stop!

703
00:45:23,824 --> 00:45:24,892
噢 操！
Oh, fuck!

704
00:45:25,025 --> 00:45:26,760
- 我们走吧 我们走吧 - 哦 操
- Let's go. Let's go. - Oh, fuck.

705
00:45:26,894 --> 00:45:28,563
他妈的！
Fuck!

706
00:45:31,031 --> 00:45:33,400
我以为 Z 世代应该是友善的
I thought Gen Z was supposed to be nice.

707
00:45:37,505 --> 00:45:39,406
我把冰块放在桶里
I got ice in a bucket.

708
00:45:39,541 --> 00:45:40,841
需要我把它放在你身上的任何地方吗？
Need me to put it anywhere on you?

709
00:45:40,975 --> 00:45:43,344
是的 我的波本威士忌 我也给你倒了一杯
Yeah, my bourbon. I poured you one too.

710
00:45:49,984 --> 00:45:51,720
好的
All right.

711
00:45:51,852 --> 00:45:53,287
- 干杯 - 干杯
- Cheers. - Cheers.

712
00:45:58,826 --> 00:46:01,762
好的
Okay.

713
00:46:05,366 --> 00:46:07,702
那么 你从哪里学会打人呢？
So, where'd you learn to beat people up?

714
00:46:09,937 --> 00:46:12,106
我小时候学过一点空手道
I took a little karate as a kid,

715
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:14,576
但当我没有获得蓝带时我就退出了
but I quit when I didn't make blue belt.

716
00:46:15,442 --> 00:46:18,245
我想我高中毕业后尝试过一些综合格斗
Then I guess I dabbled in some MMA after high school,

717
00:46:18,379 --> 00:46:20,749
但说实话 你不可能在课堂上学会打架
but honestly, you don't learn to fight in a classroom.

718
00:46:20,881 --> 00:46:22,483
你在街头学习
You learn in the streets.

719
00:46:22,617 --> 00:46:24,285
在街上？
In the streets?

720
00:46:24,418 --> 00:46:26,487
你是谁？
Who are you?

721
00:46:27,955 --> 00:46:29,123
那么 你没生气吗？
So, you're not mad?

722
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:32,092
以为你也许不会……
Thought maybe you wouldn't...

723
00:46:33,427 --> 00:46:35,162
纵容暴力或类似的事情
condone violence or something.

724
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:37,064
这是自卫
It was self-defense.

725
00:46:38,132 --> 00:46:40,134
上半场
For the first half.

726
00:46:42,369 --> 00:46:44,972
好吧 如果你要下地狱 那就继续走吧
Well, if you're going to hell, keep going.

727
00:46:45,105 --> 00:46:46,073
正确的？
Right?

728
00:46:47,408 --> 00:46:50,177
正确的
Right.

729
00:46:53,147 --> 00:46:54,982
嘿 我可以向你坦白一件事吗？
Hey, can I confess something to you?

730
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,790
我一直在使用 Rocky 的健身会员资格
I've been using Rocky's gym membership.

731
00:47:02,956 --> 00:47:04,358
假装我是他
Pretending I'm him.

732
00:47:08,596 --> 00:47:10,331
这有点糟糕 对吧？
It's kind of fucked up, right?

733
00:47:11,098 --> 00:47:12,767
是啊 那是...
Yeah, that's...

734
00:47:13,568 --> 00:47:14,536
疯狂的
crazy.

735
00:47:16,337 --> 00:47:18,673
你知道吗 前几天我实际上在那里被袭击了
You know, I actually got hit on there the other day.

736
00:47:19,641 --> 00:47:22,042
我想也许那家伙认识洛奇 所以 呃
I thought maybe the guy knew Rocky, so, uh,

737
00:47:22,577 --> 00:47:23,611
我只是顺其自然
I just went with it.

738
00:47:24,411 --> 00:47:25,647
他说了什么？
What did he say?

739
00:47:26,413 --> 00:47:28,482
他说 “有人一直在锻炼手臂 ”
He was like, "Someone's been working their arms."

740
00:47:28,616 --> 00:47:31,786
- 他没这么说 - 是啊 他说了 是啊 他……
- He did not say that. - Yeah, he did. Yeah, he...

741
00:47:31,919 --> 00:47:34,154
然后我说 “是的
Then I said, uh, "Yeah,

742
00:47:34,288 --> 00:47:36,156
你知道 我一直做得很好 ”
you know, I've been working 'em real good."

743
00:47:39,493 --> 00:47:41,663
你真是个爱开玩笑的人
You're such a tease.

744
00:47:41,796 --> 00:47:43,063
什么？我试验过了
What? I experimented.

745
00:47:43,197 --> 00:47:45,032
- 你做到了？- 嗯
- You did? - Mm.

746
00:47:48,168 --> 00:47:49,838
我 呃……
I, uh...

747
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:51,806
...曾经在聚会上亲吻过一个男人
...kissed a guy at a party once.

748
00:47:55,175 --> 00:47:57,244
那是在洛奇 (Rocky) 出道之后
It was after Rocky came out.

749
00:47:57,378 --> 00:47:59,380
我想我只是想了解一下
I think I was just trying to understand.

750
00:48:01,549 --> 00:48:02,717
我从来没有告诉过他那件事
I never told him that.

751
00:48:11,225 --> 00:48:14,194
你可以像跟洛奇一样跟我说话
You could talk to me like I'm Rocky.

752
00:48:22,236 --> 00:48:25,573
是的 所以你现在已经死了
Yeah, so you're dead now.

753
00:48:25,707 --> 00:48:27,709
这就是你不往两边看的后果
That's what you get for not looking both ways.

754
00:48:29,744 --> 00:48:31,078
你只想向前看
You only wanna look forward.

755
00:48:33,313 --> 00:48:34,948
抱歉 我甚至不知道该怎么做……
Sorry, I don't even know what to...

756
00:48:36,751 --> 00:48:38,018
我甚至不记得上次
I can't even remember the last time

757
00:48:38,152 --> 00:48:39,420
我们进行了一次真正的对话
we had a real conversation.

758
00:48:41,088 --> 00:48:44,358
那不是“工作怎么样？”你知道的 “妈妈怎么样？”
That wasn't, "How's work?" You know, "How's Mom?"

759
00:48:47,428 --> 00:48:49,296
而且它也总是按照你的时间进行
And it's always on your time too.

760
00:48:50,497 --> 00:48:51,800
有更好的事情要做 对吧？
Better things to do, right?

761
00:48:54,903 --> 00:48:57,104
第二天你就祝我“生日快乐”
You wished me a "happy birthday" the day after.

762
00:48:58,506 --> 00:49:00,040
而且 我的意思是 我知道你没有忘记
And, I mean, I know you didn't forget.

763
00:49:00,174 --> 00:49:02,943
就像 我——我很笨 但我还没有笨到那种程度
Like, I'm-I'm pretty stupid, but I'm not that fucking stupid.

764
00:49:05,045 --> 00:49:08,550
你知道吗 我实际上一直等到午夜 以防万一
You know, I actually waited until midnight, just in case,

765
00:49:08,683 --> 00:49:11,485
然后...然后第二个...
and... and the second it...

766
00:49:13,387 --> 00:49:14,823
好吧 我突然发怒了 因为......
Well, I snapped, 'cause...

767
00:49:16,624 --> 00:49:18,660
说实话 你真是太自私了
to be honest, you're so fucking selfish.

768
00:49:21,629 --> 00:49:24,097
就像 什么 你不——你……你不想和我打交道？
Like, what, you don't-- you... you don't wanna deal with me?

769
00:49:24,899 --> 00:49:27,968
你知道 我很抱歉我不读政治
You know, I'm-- I'm sorry I don't read politics,

770
00:49:28,101 --> 00:49:30,905
或者......喜欢 或者其他什么 但是 喜欢......
or... ...like, or whatever, but, like...

771
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:36,911
你知道吗？
You know what?

772
00:49:37,812 --> 00:49:39,914
我们之所以变成这样都是你的错
It's your fucking fault we're like this.

773
00:49:41,616 --> 00:49:43,651
是的 你迫不及待地想离开 我的意思是 我会……
Yeah, you couldn't wait to get away. I mean, I would've,

774
00:49:44,151 --> 00:49:45,620
我会跟随你去上大学
I would've followed you to college.

775
00:49:45,753 --> 00:49:47,287
我本来会去日本 我就会弄清楚的
I would've gone to Japan. I would've figured it out.

776
00:49:48,656 --> 00:49:50,324
但你根本就没问过我！
But you never even fucking asked me!

777
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:56,798
对不起
Sorry.

778
00:49:59,734 --> 00:50:01,101
对不起！
I'm sorry!

779
00:50:01,235 --> 00:50:03,170
抱歉 我无法控制自己的愤怒
I'm sorry I can't control my anger.

780
00:50:06,139 --> 00:50:09,343
我很抱歉 当你告诉我你喜欢男人时 我对你大发雷霆
And I'm sorry I blew up at you when you told me you like guys.

781
00:50:12,947 --> 00:50:14,883
对不起 我叫你同性恋
I'm sorry I called you a faggot.

782
00:50:17,585 --> 00:50:19,486
我希望我能把它拿回来
I wish I could take it back.

783
00:50:21,154 --> 00:50:22,891
哦 当我说这句话时你的表情
Oh, and your face when I said it,

784
00:50:23,056 --> 00:50:25,025
我...
I...

785
00:50:25,158 --> 00:50:26,661
我知道这就是你离开的原因！
I know that's why you left!

786
00:50:29,096 --> 00:50:32,901
我想我只是——我害怕……
I think I was just-- I was scared that...

787
00:50:33,033 --> 00:50:35,168
我不知道...我不知道
I don't... I don't know.

788
00:50:36,004 --> 00:50:38,673
如果我没有……如果我没有……
If I didn't... if I didn't...

789
00:50:41,041 --> 00:50:43,043
如果你不像我 我们不一样
If you weren't like me, and we weren't the same,

790
00:50:43,176 --> 00:50:45,379
那样的话……我就不知道我是谁了 你知道吗？
then... then I wouldn't know who I was, you know?

791
00:50:45,513 --> 00:50:47,314
但那——但没关系 因为你……
But that-- but that's okay, because you...

792
00:50:47,447 --> 00:50:49,551
你可以谈论男人 我可以谈论女人
you can talk about guys, and I can talk about girls,

793
00:50:49,684 --> 00:50:51,653
而我们仍然……
and we both still...

794
00:50:51,786 --> 00:50:56,156
你知道 比如电子游戏、曲棍球和披萨
you know, like video games, and-and hockey, and pizza.

795
00:50:56,290 --> 00:50:58,492
嗯 每个人都喜欢披萨
Well, everybody likes pizza.

796
00:51:02,697 --> 00:51:05,198
没有你我真不知道该怎么办
I don't know how to fucking be here without you.

797
00:51:09,871 --> 00:51:12,774
没有你我真不知道该怎么办！
I don't know how to fucking be here without you!

798
00:51:14,709 --> 00:51:18,445
没有你我真不知道该怎么办！
I don't know how to fucking be here without you!

799
00:51:35,897 --> 00:51:37,732
我希望你能见到洛基
I wish you could've met Rocky.

800
00:51:41,569 --> 00:51:43,236
他一定会非常喜欢你
He would've really liked you.

801
00:51:55,583 --> 00:51:57,085
那里可能没有很多人
There might not be a lot of people there.

802
00:51:57,217 --> 00:52:00,153
只是让你知道 呃 玛西有点......
Just so you know, uh, Marcie's kind of a...

803
00:52:00,287 --> 00:52:02,389
我的意思是 我不想说她是个失败者 但是
I mean, I don't wanna say she's a loser, but,

804
00:52:02,523 --> 00:52:03,725
我的意思是 你会看到的
I mean, you'll see.

805
00:52:11,866 --> 00:52:12,800
羅馬？
Roman?

806
00:52:13,935 --> 00:52:15,837
哇哦 萨米 你在这里干什么？
Whoa, Sammy. What are you doing here?

807
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:18,006
哦 我和 Marcie 一起参加了木工课
Oh, I took a woodworking class with Marcie.

808
00:52:18,138 --> 00:52:19,406
你在这里干什么？
What are you doing here?

809
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:21,676
这是我的朋友丹尼斯 他和玛西一起工作
This is my buddy Dennis. He works with Marcie.

810
00:52:22,476 --> 00:52:24,679
哦 嘿 怎么了？我是萨米
Oh, hey, what's up? I'm-I'm Sammy.

811
00:52:24,812 --> 00:52:26,346
你好
Hi.

812
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,582
他是工作上的同性恋
He's the gay guy from work

813
00:52:27,715 --> 00:52:29,017
我正跟你说过
I was telling you about.

814
00:52:29,149 --> 00:52:30,685
几率有多大？
What are the odds?

815
00:52:30,818 --> 00:52:32,319
你好 我听说我们有很多共同点

00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,088
你？
Do you?

817
00:52:34,221 --> 00:52:35,590
我去给我们拿几杯饮料
I'll go get us a couple of drinks.

818
00:52:35,723 --> 00:52:37,692
呃 你们俩为什么不交往一下呢？
Why don't, uh, you two mingle?

819
00:52:46,466 --> 00:52:48,770
- 哦 我他妈的讨厌那首歌  - 我喜欢这首歌
- Oh, I fucking hate that song. - I love this song.

我的手很柔软
I have soft hands.

824
00:53:04,184 --> 00:53:05,653
- 太棒了 - 有人告诉我我有手
- Cool. - I was told I have the hands

825
00:53:05,787 --> 00:53:07,320
那些一生中从未工作过一天的人
of somebody who's never worked a day in their life.

826
00:53:07,454 --> 00:53:09,456

827
00:53:11,125 --> 00:53:12,060

830
00:53:15,596 --> 00:53:17,197

非常柔软
Very soft.

832
00:53:22,937 --> 00:53:23,871
是的
Yeah.

833
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:26,741
一...
Um...

834
00:53:28,142 --> 00:53:29,677
还有其他爱好吗？
any other hobbies?

835
00:53:29,811 --> 00:53:34,314
徒步旅行、滑雪、滑翔伞、攀岩、山地滑板、
Hiking, skiing, paragliding, rock climbing, mountainboarding,

836
00:53:34,448 --> 00:53:36,918
激流漂流 跑酷
white water rafting. Parkour.

837
00:53:37,652 --> 00:53:39,219
感觉太多了
Feel like that's too many.

838
00:53:39,352 --> 00:53:40,688
这有点问题
It's a bit of a problem.

839
00:53:40,822 --> 00:53:43,191
你知道吗 我有点儿像个肾上腺素瘾君子？
I'm sort of an adrena-junkie, you know?

840
00:53:43,356 --> 00:53:45,159
跑酷不是很危险吗？
Isn't parkour dangerous?

841
00:53:45,292 --> 00:53:47,360
- 没有 - 但是这样做会死人吗？
- No. - But people die doing it?

842
00:53:47,962 --> 00:53:48,996
是的
Yes.

843
00:53:50,531 --> 00:53:51,699
好的
Okay.

844
00:53:51,833 --> 00:53:54,001
你只需要知道自己的极限
You just have to know your limits.

845
00:53:54,135 --> 00:53:56,938
我不知道我的极限！
I don't know my limits!

846
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:00,240
比如 今年你做过的最疯狂的事情是什么？
Like, what's the wildest thing you did this year?

847
00:54:02,043 --> 00:54:03,878
什么都想不起来了 嗯……
Nothing comes to mind. Um...

848
00:54:05,012 --> 00:54:06,681
陪审义务 或者我几乎——
jury duty. Or I almost--

849
00:54:06,814 --> 00:54:09,249
我和他们有冲突 所以他们没有选我
I had a conflict, so they didn't pick me.

850
00:54:12,687 --> 00:54:14,589
你真可爱
You're cute.

851
00:54:20,194 --> 00:54:21,963
哦 你从来没有玩过原版的《模拟人生》？
Oh, you never played the original Sims?

852
00:54:22,096 --> 00:54:23,631
噢 天哪 这是最好的
Oh, man, it's the best.

853
00:54:23,765 --> 00:54:25,600
事实上 很多人没有意识到这真的很难
Actually, a lot of people don't realize it was really hard.

854
00:54:25,733 --> 00:54:27,135
因为你没有周末
'Cause you don't get weekends,

855
00:54:27,267 --> 00:54:28,936
所以你必须把所有时间都花在上班上
so you have to spend all your time going to work,

856
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:31,139
睡觉、洗澡、打扫、做饭
going to sleep, showering, cleaning, cooking,

857
00:54:31,271 --> 00:54:33,708
拉屎 你知道吗？抱歉
pooping, you know? Sorry.

858
00:54:33,841 --> 00:54:35,810
但是 是的 你确实必须满足他们的需求
But, yeah, you really have to tend to their needs,

859
00:54:35,943 --> 00:54:37,945
因为 嗯 他们会让你知道这件事
'cause, um, they'll let you know about it.

860
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,446
他们变得非常暴躁
They get very cranky.

861
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:42,415
嗯 他们会尿裤子的
Um, they'll pee their pants.

862
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:45,987
事实上 他们会变得非常沮丧
They'll, uh, get very depressed, actually.

863
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,287
他们可能会变得沮丧
They can get depressed.

864
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:49,257
哦 哇 我……
Oh. Wow. I...

865
00:54:49,957 --> 00:54:51,759
我一直认为这是一个愚蠢的游戏
I always just thought it was a silly game

866
00:54:51,893 --> 00:54:54,095
- 他们在那里胡言乱语 - 不 不 不
- where they talk gibberish. - No, no, no.

867
00:54:54,228 --> 00:54:57,397
有风险 是啊 生死攸关
There's stakes. Yeah. It's life or death out there.

868
00:54:57,532 --> 00:54:59,801
这实际上并不是胡言乱语 而是模拟英语
And it's actually not gibberish. It's Simlish.

869
00:55:00,535 --> 00:55:02,335
这就像是它自己的语言
It's like it's whole own language.

870
00:55:09,544 --> 00:55:11,512
对不起
Sorry.

871
00:55:11,646 --> 00:55:13,247
抱歉 这太蠢了
Sorry. That's dumb.

872
00:55:14,282 --> 00:55:16,416
不 真的很甜
No, it's really sweet.

873
00:55:16,551 --> 00:55:18,686
这是我小时候最喜欢的游戏
It was just my favorite game when I was a kid.

874
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,155
我有一个双胞胎兄弟
I have a twin brother.

875
00:55:21,289 --> 00:55:24,158
我们太着迷了 所以我们就玩它
We were obsessed with it, so we just would play it

876
00:55:24,292 --> 00:55:25,793
一起度过了几个小时
for hours together.

877
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:29,530
真实时间 不是模拟时间 是的
Real hours, not Sims hours. Yeah.

878
00:55:29,664 --> 00:55:31,498
我内心深处一直以为这就是我的生活
Part of me always thought that's what my life would be like

879
00:55:31,632 --> 00:55:33,034
当我们也长大了
when we got older too.

880
00:55:33,167 --> 00:55:34,434
洛基和我会有一栋房子
Rocky and I would get a house

881
00:55:34,569 --> 00:55:36,369
在 SuperDoop 上投篮
and shoot hoops on the SuperDoop,

882
00:55:36,504 --> 00:55:38,039
在热水浴缸里聊天
talk in the hot tub.

883
00:55:38,172 --> 00:55:39,774
我一直是呆在家里的双胞胎
I was always the stay-at-home twin.

884
00:55:39,907 --> 00:55:42,009
他会得到这份工作、晋升
He'd get the job, the promotion,

885
00:55:42,143 --> 00:55:45,513
我会打扫房子 修理东西
and I'd kind of clean the house, and, you know, fix things,

886
00:55:45,646 --> 00:55:47,982
做饭 然后……
and cook the meals, and...

887
00:55:49,449 --> 00:55:50,818
我也总是会烧毁厨房
I'd always burn down the kitchen too.

888
00:55:50,952 --> 00:55:52,720
呃 他讨厌那样
Uh, he hated that.

889
00:55:53,688 --> 00:55:55,289
你和 Rocky 还一起玩吗？
Do you and Rocky still play?

890
00:55:55,422 --> 00:55:57,525
不 他 呃
No, he, uh,

891
00:55:57,658 --> 00:56:00,127
事实上 他几个月前就去世了
he passed away a couple months ago, actually.

892
00:56:00,862 --> 00:56:02,296
哦 不
Oh, no.

893
00:56:03,331 --> 00:56:05,299
- 我很抱歉  - 没关系
- I'm so sorry. - Nah, it's okay.

894
00:56:05,867 --> 00:56:08,202
嗯 我的意思是 你不知道
Um, I mean, you didn't know.

895
00:56:10,638 --> 00:56:13,307
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

896
00:56:14,675 --> 00:56:17,511
- 哦…… - 玛西！开心——
- Oh... - Marcie! Happy--

897
00:56:17,645 --> 00:56:20,413
- 哦 天哪 你还好吗？ - 我很好
- Oh, my God. Are you okay? - I'm fine.

898
00:56:20,548 --> 00:56:23,383
我只是一个情绪化的饮酒者
I'm just an emotional drinker.

899
00:56:23,517 --> 00:56:25,653
雪莉 万圣节快乐
Shelly, happy Halloween.

900
00:56:25,786 --> 00:56:27,355
- 万圣节快乐！ - 你看起来棒极了
- Happy Halloween! - You look so great.

901
00:56:27,487 --> 00:56:29,357
谢谢你！
Thank you!

902
00:56:51,178 --> 00:56:52,713
- 嘿 玛西 - 嗨 丹尼斯
- Hey, Marcie. - Hi, Dennis.

903
00:56:52,847 --> 00:56:54,882
- 很棒的派对 - 是的 谢谢你来
- Great party. - Yeah. Thanks for coming.

904
00:56:55,016 --> 00:56:56,784
你朋友那么多 我怎么也想不到
You have so many friends. Never would've guessed.

905
00:56:56,918 --> 00:56:58,519
真的吗？嗯
Really? Huh.

906
00:56:58,653 --> 00:56:59,954
是的 这很有趣
That's interesting, yeah.

907
00:57:00,087 --> 00:57:01,789
我的意思是 工作中的每个人都会以某种方式看待你
I mean, everyone at work sees you a certain way,

908
00:57:01,923 --> 00:57:04,491
但我实际上是 ENFP 型人格
but I'm actually an ENFP personality.

909
00:57:04,625 --> 00:57:05,860
虽然我在这里工作的第一周
Although my first week working here,

910
00:57:05,993 --> 00:57:07,261
我当时正在克服单核细胞增多症
I was getting over mono,

911
00:57:07,395 --> 00:57:08,629
所以我尽量避免感染任何人
so I tried to avoid infecting anyone,

912
00:57:08,763 --> 00:57:10,531
我觉得我给人留下了不好的印象
and I think I made a bad impression.

913
00:57:10,665 --> 00:57:12,066
- 你怎么会得单核细胞增多症？ - 我不知道
- How'd you get mono? - I don't know.

914
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,269
但我在大学时曾担任研究助理 后来又在 Kappa Delta 工作
But I was an RA in college, and then Kappa Delta,

915
00:57:15,403 --> 00:57:17,872
所以我和其他十个女孩共用一个淋浴间没有问题
so I have no problem sharing a shower with ten other girls.

916
00:57:18,005 --> 00:57:19,240
这就是你得单声道病的原因吗？
That's how you got mono?

917
00:57:19,373 --> 00:57:20,473
不
No.

918
00:57:21,075 --> 00:57:22,944
我只是说我一直都是一个外向的人
I'm just saying I've always been an extrovert.

919
00:57:23,077 --> 00:57:24,045
我只是爱人们
I just love people.

920
00:57:24,178 --> 00:57:25,813
哦
Oh.

921
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:27,748
接待
Reception.

922
00:57:27,882 --> 00:57:28,983
让我帮您转接
Let me transfer you.

923
00:57:30,785 --> 00:57:33,254
抱歉 你让我胡言乱语了 呃 你需要什么吗？
I'm sorry, you got me babbling. Um, did you need something?

924
00:57:33,387 --> 00:57:35,222
你还记得我的朋友罗曼吗？
Do you remember my friend Roman?

925
00:57:35,356 --> 00:57:37,959
哦 天哪 是的 他真是……
Oh, my gosh, yes. He is so...

926
00:57:38,759 --> 00:57:40,127
嗯 我真的很喜欢他
Um, I really liked him.

927
00:57:40,261 --> 00:57:41,429
嗯 我们在想
Well, we were thinking

928
00:57:41,562 --> 00:57:43,264
有时候一起出去玩可能会很有趣
it might be fun to hang out sometime.

929
00:57:43,397 --> 00:57:45,266
一起 就像一次四人约会
Together. Like a double date.

930
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:48,269
罗曼会是我的指定约会对象吗？
And Roman would be my designated date?

931
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:50,438
是的 这还不清楚吗？
Yes. Was that not clear?

932
00:57:50,571 --> 00:57:54,108
- 哦 天哪！ - 嗯……是的！
- Oh, my gosh! - Um... ...yes!

933
00:57:54,241 --> 00:57:56,243
我非常在意
I'm so there.

934
00:57:56,377 --> 00:57:58,079
哦 嘿 萨米 你好吗？
Oh, hey, Sammy. How you doing?

935
00:57:58,212 --> 00:58:01,015
- 嘿 发生什么事了？ - 没什么 没什么
- Hey, what's up? - Nothing. Nothing.

936
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:04,919
这个周末遇见你真是太好了
It was cool running into you this weekend.

937
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:08,990
呃 嘿 你觉得我的朋友丹尼斯怎么样？
Uh, hey, what'd you think of my friend Dennis?

938
00:58:10,691 --> 00:58:12,360
- 没有 - 好的
- No. - Okay.

939
00:58:17,965 --> 00:58:19,633
- 他在这里做什么？ - 我又碰到他了
- What is he doing here? - I ran into him again.

940
00:58:19,767 --> 00:58:20,935
你告诉我你认为他很有魅力
You told me you thought he was attractive.

941
00:58:21,068 --> 00:58:22,269
萨米怎么了？萨米很棒
What happened to Sammy? Sammy was great.

942
00:58:22,403 --> 00:58:23,537
Sammy 说他觉得你很可爱
Sammy said that he thought you were cute,

943
00:58:23,671 --> 00:58:24,772
但他并不可爱
but that he doesn't do cute.

944
00:58:24,905 --> 00:58:26,440
- 我做不到！ - 是的 你可以
- I can't do this! - Yes, you can.

945
00:58:26,574 --> 00:58:27,975
我解释了一切
I explained everything.

946
00:58:28,109 --> 00:58:30,277
他知道你实际上不是来自伦敦
He knows you're not really from London.

947
00:58:36,751 --> 00:58:38,285
我对贝类过敏
I'm allergic to shellfish,

948
00:58:38,419 --> 00:58:40,688
我曾经从滑雪缆车上摔下来过……
I once fell off a ski lift...

949
00:58:40,821 --> 00:58:43,157
...嗯 我从来没有
...um, and I've never been

950
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:45,793
- 去另一个国家 - 没有人从滑雪缆车上掉下来
- to another country. - Nobody falls off a ski lift.

951
00:58:45,926 --> 00:58:47,661
每个人都去过另一个国家
Everybody's been to another country.

952
00:58:48,262 --> 00:58:49,997
- 我去过加拿大一次  - 好的
- I've been to Canada one time. - Okay.

953
00:58:50,131 --> 00:58:52,233
哦天哪 好吧 你懂我意思了
Oh, gosh. Okay, you got me.

954
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:55,136
等一下 嗯 那你是怎么从滑雪缆车上摔下来的？
Wait. Um, so how did you fall off a ski lift?

955
00:58:55,269 --> 00:58:56,837
呃 我们小时候 我们进行了一次圣诞旅行
Uh, we were kids, we took a Christmas trip

956
00:58:56,971 --> 00:58:59,740
有一次去太阳谷 洛奇掉了手套
to Sun Valley once, and Rocky dropped his glove,

957
00:58:59,874 --> 00:59:01,809
我伸手去抓它
and I reached for it and tried to grab it.

958
00:59:01,942 --> 00:59:03,144
是的
Yeah.

959
00:59:03,277 --> 00:59:05,813
头先出来 十、十五英尺
Head first, ten, 15 feet.

960
00:59:05,946 --> 00:59:08,349
呃 我记得刚刚听到手腕上传来一声脆响
Uh, I remember just hearing this snap in my wrist.

961
00:59:08,482 --> 00:59:10,151
- 天啊 - 是啊
- Jesus. - Yeah.

962
00:59:10,284 --> 00:59:12,521
- 我喜欢滑雪 - 哦 不可能 你喜欢滑雪吗？
- I love skiing. - Oh, no way. You like skiing?

963
00:59:12,653 --> 00:59:13,721
是的 是的 II 滑雪
Yeah, yeah. I-I ski.

964
00:59:13,854 --> 00:59:15,356
- 嗯 我来自密歇根  - 很酷
- Um, I'm from Michigan. - That's cool.

965
00:59:15,489 --> 00:59:16,857
- 你甚至没有口音  - 好吧 轮到我了
- You don't even have an accent. - Okay, my turn.

966
00:59:16,991 --> 00:59:20,061
我不会吹口哨 我曾经把我的猫面条换了
I can't whistle, I once traded my cat Noodles

967
00:59:20,194 --> 00:59:22,763
送给我邻居的戴安娜王妃豆豆娃
for my neighbor's Princess Diana Beanie Baby.

968
00:59:22,897 --> 00:59:24,331
数小时后 该交易被撤销
The deal was revoked hours later.

969
00:59:24,465 --> 00:59:27,468
还有什么？还有什么？嗯 哦
And what else, what else? Um, oh.

970
00:59:27,635 --> 00:59:30,404
我参加了《真实世界》的试镜……
I auditioned for The Real World...

971
00:59:30,571 --> 00:59:32,273
...我上大学的时候在圣地亚哥
...San Diego when I was in college.

972
00:59:32,406 --> 00:59:35,876
嗯 你的第二个问题太具体了 不可能是谎言
Mm, your second one is too specific to be a lie.

973
00:59:36,043 --> 00:59:38,712
你也没有参加《真实世界》的试镜
And you didn't audition for Real World.

974
00:59:38,846 --> 00:59:40,581
是的 你在最后一个之前犹豫了
Yeah, you hesitated before that last one.

975
00:59:40,714 --> 00:59:42,450
- 我认为那是...那可能是谎言 - 是的
- I think that's... that's probably the lie. - Yeah.

976
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:45,753
我想你会吹口哨 对吧？
I think you can whistle, right?

977
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,355
- 我从来没有养过猫  - 哦 天哪！
- I've never had a cat. - Oh, my God!

978
00:59:48,489 --> 00:59:50,224
- 什么？ - 你很擅长这个
- What? - You are so good at this.

979
00:59:50,357 --> 00:59:52,093
是的 诀窍就是说点什么
Yeah. Well, the trick is to say something

980
00:59:52,226 --> 00:59:56,531
从情感上来说这是正确的 但从事实上来说却是错误的
that is emotionally true but factually false.

981
00:59:58,265 --> 01:00:00,535
- 是啊 - 好的 嗯 轮到我了
- Yeah. - Okay, um, my turn.

982
01:00:00,668 --> 01:00:02,136
呃 当我十岁的时候
Uh, when I was ten,

983
01:00:02,269 --> 01:00:05,574
我在一次跳水事故中差点失去了一个睾丸……
I almost lost a testicle in a diving board accident...

984
01:00:20,421 --> 01:00:21,755
你知道 我曾经感觉...
You know, I used to feel...

985
01:00:25,659 --> 01:00:29,296
我不想说单身人士“优越” 但是......
I don't wanna say "superior" to singletons, but...

986
01:00:32,366 --> 01:00:33,901
是的 我为他们感到难过
Yeah, like, I felt bad for them.

987
01:00:35,769 --> 01:00:37,506
现在 我和其他人一样
And now, I'm just like everybody else.

988
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,441
除了更糟的情况
Except worse.

989
01:00:41,876 --> 01:00:42,843
因为我知道
Because I know.

990
01:00:46,548 --> 01:00:48,782
无论我走到哪里 都能看到双胞胎
I see twins everywhere I go.

991
01:00:49,618 --> 01:00:51,252
我的酒吧 我的公园
My bar, my park.

992
01:00:51,986 --> 01:00:53,487
我不得不换果汁店
I had to switch juiceries,

993
01:00:53,622 --> 01:00:56,290
因为我雇佣了双胞胎收银员
because my go-to hired twin cashiers.

994
01:00:56,790 --> 01:00:57,892
- 嗨 孩子们 - 嘿
- Hi, boys. - Hey.

995
01:00:58,025 --> 01:00:59,360
- 早上好 - 早上好
- And good morning. - Morning.

996
01:00:59,493 --> 01:01:00,961
我偷偷地通过了安检
I snuck it past security.

997
01:01:01,095 --> 01:01:03,797
- 天哪 你太淘气了  - 不 我没有
- My God, you're so naughty. - No, I didn't.

998
01:01:03,931 --> 01:01:05,933
- 我只是很有礼貌地问一下  - 哦
- I just asked really politely. - Oh.

999
01:01:06,066 --> 01:01:07,468
我本来想给你买一个 但罗曼说
I would've brought you one, but Roman says

1000
01:01:07,602 --> 01:01:08,836
你不喝咖啡
you don't drink coffee.

1001
01:01:08,969 --> 01:01:10,971
是的 咖啡对牙齿不好 我喝茶
Yeah, coffee's bad for your teeth. I drink tea.

1002
01:01:12,574 --> 01:01:14,375
你知道 茶实际上含有
You know, tea actually contains

1003
01:01:14,509 --> 01:01:16,010
单宁含量比咖啡高
a higher tannin content than coffee,

1004
01:01:16,143 --> 01:01:18,112
所以它更容易弄脏你的牙齿
so it's more likely to stain your teeth.

1005
01:01:18,245 --> 01:01:19,680
- 有趣的事实！ - 我不知道
- Interesting fact! - I didn't know that.

1006
01:01:19,813 --> 01:01:22,651
- 是的 - 仅供参考 星巴克卖茶
- Yeah. - Starbucks sells tea, FYI.

1007
01:01:22,783 --> 01:01:24,151
哦 我自己煮咖啡
Oh, I brew my own coffee.

1008
01:01:24,285 --> 01:01:26,320
我真的很喜欢他们的旅行杯
I just really like their travel mugs.

1009
01:01:30,024 --> 01:01:31,626
- 你今天看起来真可爱 - 谢谢 宝贝
- You look really cute today. - Thanks, baby.

1010
01:02:00,387 --> 01:02:01,755
哦 丹尼斯
Oh, Dennis.

1011
01:02:01,889 --> 01:02:03,357
我昨天在健身房看到一对双胞胎
I saw a pair of twins at the gym yesterday,

1012
01:02:03,490 --> 01:02:06,026
然后我在回家的路上又看到了另一对双胞胎
and then I saw another pair of twins on my walk home.

1013
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,928
就好像它们无处不在一样
It's like they're everywhere.

1014
01:02:08,062 --> 01:02:10,197
- 这就是频率错觉 - 什么？
- That's the frequency illusion. - What?

1015
01:02:10,331 --> 01:02:12,601
又称巴德尔-迈因霍夫现象
Also known as the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon.

1016
01:02:12,733 --> 01:02:14,669
就像我得到我的海军蓝普锐斯时一样
It's like when I got my navy blue Prius.

1017
01:02:14,802 --> 01:02:17,004
突然间 我到处都能看到深蓝色的普锐斯
Suddenly, I was seeing navy blue Prii everywhere,

1018
01:02:17,137 --> 01:02:19,273
但它们一直都在那里 只是我没有注意到
but they'd always been there, I just wasn't paying attention.

1019
01:02:19,406 --> 01:02:22,076
你今天真聪明 我的意思是 你每天都很聪明
You are so smart today. I mean, you're smart every day,

1020
01:02:22,209 --> 01:02:23,678
- 但尤其是今天 - 不！
- but especially today. - No!

1021
01:02:23,811 --> 01:02:25,112
我主修心理学
I was a psychology major.

1022
01:02:25,246 --> 01:02:27,181
这就是你担任接待员的原因
That's why you're a receptionist.

1023
01:02:27,314 --> 01:02:28,617
因为你很善于与人相处
'Cause you're so good with people.

1024
01:02:28,749 --> 01:02:30,918
谢谢 丹尼斯
Thanks, Dennis.

1025
01:02:31,051 --> 01:02:34,221
不管怎样 它让我想起了我们在小组里的讨论
Anyway, it, uh, reminded me of the discussion we had in group.

1026
01:02:34,689 --> 01:02:36,123
什么群？
What group?

1027
01:02:36,257 --> 01:02:38,058
我一直在谈论的支持小组
The support group I'm always talking about.

1028
01:02:38,727 --> 01:02:41,028
等等 丹尼斯有双胞胎吗？
Wait, does Dennis have a twin?

1029
01:02:41,161 --> 01:02:44,064
是的 我们就是这样认识的 我好像跟你说过
Yeah, that's how we met. I thought I told you this.

1030
01:02:44,198 --> 01:02:45,266
不 我……
No, I...

1031
01:02:45,866 --> 01:02:47,535
丹尼斯 你告诉我你是独生子
Dennis, you told me you were an only child.

1032
01:02:47,669 --> 01:02:49,303
- 嗯 我没告诉你 - 是啊 是啊！
- Mm, I didn't tell you that. - Yeah, yeah!

1033
01:02:49,436 --> 01:02:50,739
星期五是百吉饼日
It was bagel Friday.

1034
01:02:50,871 --> 01:02:52,707
我记得 因为我也是独生子
I remember, because I'm an only child too,

1035
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,408
而且我们都是狮子座
and-and we're both Leos.

1036
01:02:54,542 --> 01:02:57,278
嗯 我现在是独生子
Well, I am an only child now,

1037
01:02:57,411 --> 01:02:59,880
因为我的双胞胎兄弟迪恩去世了 这对我而言非常私人
because my twin, Dean, died, and it's very personal,

1038
01:03:00,014 --> 01:03:02,216
所以我想我不太愿意告诉你这件事
so I guess I didn't feel comfortable telling you that.

1039
01:03:02,783 --> 01:03:04,451
- 非常抱歉  - 没关系
- I'm so sorry. - It's fine.

1040
01:03:04,586 --> 01:03:07,756
没关系
It's okay.

1041
01:03:07,888 --> 01:03:09,890
你知道吗 我感觉自己像个傻瓜
You know, I feel like such a doofus,

1042
01:03:10,024 --> 01:03:11,726
因为有一次在工作中
because there was that one time at work

1043
01:03:11,892 --> 01:03:14,228
几个月前 我不想打探
a couple of months ago, and I didn't want to pry,

1044
01:03:14,361 --> 01:03:15,796
但你却如此悲伤
but you were so sad,

1045
01:03:15,929 --> 01:03:18,465
而且你有点难以理解
and-and you were kind of hard to understand,

1046
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:19,933
但你刚才说的是
but you were saying something about

1047
01:03:20,067 --> 01:03:21,969
你一生的挚爱是如何被——
how the love of your life had been hit by a--

1048
01:03:22,102 --> 01:03:25,640
不！住手！
No! Stop!

1049
01:03:25,774 --> 01:03:27,241
- 丹尼斯？- 你还好吗 伙计？
- Dennis? - You okay, man?

1050
01:03:27,374 --> 01:03:29,977
呃 我得离开这里！我有幽闭恐惧症
Uh, I-I need to get out of here! I'm-I'm claustrophobic,

1051
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:31,979
我不想谈论 Dean！
and I don't wanna talk about Dean!

1052
01:03:32,112 --> 01:03:33,782
我认为他正处于焦虑症发作中
I think he's having an anxiety attack.

1053
01:03:33,914 --> 01:03:36,518
是的！我焦虑症发作了！
Yes! I-I'm having an anxiety attack!

1054
01:03:36,651 --> 01:03:40,522
焦虑症发作！焦虑症发作！
Anxiety attack! Anxiety attack!

1055
01:03:48,797 --> 01:03:51,131
- 嘿 - 所以 我和经理莎伦谈过了——
- Hey. - So, I spoke with Sharon, the manager--

1056
01:03:51,265 --> 01:03:52,701
噢 她真是个甜心
Oh, she's a sweetheart.

1057
01:03:52,833 --> 01:03:54,301
我们想要信用还是退款？
Do we want credit or a refund?

1058
01:03:55,069 --> 01:03:56,270
- 退款 - 信用
- Refund. - Credit.

1059
01:03:59,774 --> 01:04:01,041
乔尼死了
Jonny died.

1060
01:04:02,176 --> 01:04:03,344
我的狗
My dog.

1061
01:04:04,111 --> 01:04:07,114
我不应该用我哥哥的名字给他命名
I shouldn't have named him after my brother.

1062
01:04:08,182 --> 01:04:10,317
就好像他又重新经历了一切
It's like he's gone all over again.

1063
01:04:11,418 --> 01:04:16,056
乔尼死后 真正的乔尼
After... Jonny died, the real Jonny,

1064
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:18,459
我开始对我的妻子产生依赖
I became glued to my wife.

1065
01:04:19,927 --> 01:04:22,731
她说我想取代我的兄弟……
She said I was trying to replace my brother...

1066
01:04:44,619 --> 01:04:46,420
- 丹尼斯 - 也许你应该得到它
- Dennis. - Maybe you should get it.

1067
01:04:46,554 --> 01:04:48,590
已经是第三次了 可能是紧急情况！
It's the third time. It could be an emergency!

1068
01:04:50,057 --> 01:04:52,059
哦天哪 糟了
Oh, my God. Shit.

1069
01:04:55,462 --> 01:04:57,766
嘿 哥们 很晚了 还好吗？
Hey, buddy, it's late. Everything okay?

1070
01:04:57,931 --> 01:04:59,534
是的 抱歉 我吵醒你了吗？
Yeah, sorry. Did I wake you?

1071
01:04:59,667 --> 01:05:01,536
不 不 只是 呃 和玛西一起玩
No, no. Just, uh, hanging with Marcie.

1072
01:05:01,669 --> 01:05:03,671
哦 对了 玛西 她太需要我了
Oh, right, Marcie. So needy.

1073
01:05:03,805 --> 01:05:07,007
- 呃 你正在使用免提通话  - 你好 丹尼斯
- Uh, you're on speaker. - Hi, Dennis.

1074
01:05:07,141 --> 01:05:08,175
那么这是什么一回事？
So, what's up?

1075
01:05:08,976 --> 01:05:11,445
只是想看看你在做什么
Just wanted to see what you were doing.

1076
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:14,181
呃 我们什么都没做 只是谈论圣诞节
Uh, we're doing nothing, talking about Christmas

1077
01:05:14,314 --> 01:05:18,185
还有长袜和所有我们想塞进去的东西
and stockings and all the stuff we want to stuff in them.

1078
01:05:18,318 --> 01:05:20,087
不错 嗯

Why don't we call the fucking butler?

节日到了！为什么不买棵树呢？
It's the holiday! Why wouldn't you get a tree?

- No! - It's selfish! Yes, it is!

1104
01:06:34,762 --> 01:06:36,865
别这样对我！你怎么能这样对我？
Don't say that to me! How can you say that to me?

1105
01:06:36,997 --> 01:06:38,666
因为这根本就是事实！
Because it's the fucking truth!

1106
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,768
这不是他想要的！这他妈的根本不是他想要的！
It's not what he wanted! It's not fucking what he wanted!

1107
01:06:40,902 --> 01:06:42,804
你不知道这一点 你并非无所不知
You don't know that. You don't know everything.

Idaho... Hasn't even fucking lived here for ten years!

1113

你认为我太刻薄了吗？
Do you think I was being too mean?

1114
01:06:58,987 --> 01:07:01,388
我想你们俩都很悲伤
I think you're both grieving.

1115

- We can still save Christmas. - What's the point?

1117

如果你要下地狱 那就继续走吧
If you're going to hell, keep going.

1118
01:07:14,836 --> 01:07:16,571
- “穿越地狱 ” - 嗯？
- "Through hell." - Hmm?

1119
01:07:17,505 --> 01:07:19,807
“如果你正在经历地狱般的生活 那就坚持下去 ”
"If you're going through hell, keep going."

1120
01:07:20,608 --> 01:07:21,676
因为它会变得更好
Because it gets better.

1121

01:13:24,538 --> 01:13:26,841
她说他们的记录里没有 Dean Benver 这个名字
and she said there was no Dean Benver in their records.

1211
01:13:26,974 --> 01:13:28,542
昨晚我打电话给凯文·罗斯
And then last night, I called Kevin Ross,

1212
01:13:28,676 --> 01:13:30,011
我看到你和谁一起上高中
who I saw you went to high school with.

1213
01:13:30,144 --> 01:13:31,779
我在油画课上认识了他
I met him in an oil painting class,

1214
01:13:31,913 --> 01:13:33,614
他说你没有兄弟
and he said you didn't have a brother

1215
01:13:33,748 --> 01:13:36,717
他百分之百确定 因为你每天午餐都独自坐着
and he's 100 percent sure because you sat alone at lunch every day

1216
01:13:36,851 --> 01:13:38,386
他妈妈让他去参加你的生日聚会
and his mom made him go to your birthday party

1217
01:13:38,519 --> 01:13:40,288
没有其他人出现 你有一张单人床
and no one else showed up and you have a twin bed,

1218
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:42,455
但只有一个 而且他还让它听起来像
but just one, and he also made it sound like

1219
01:13:42,590 --> 01:13:44,091
你胡闹了 但我不确定
you fooled around in it, but I couldn't be sure

1220
01:13:44,225 --> 01:13:45,393
因为我听到他妻子在后面说话——
'cause I heard his wife in the background--

1221
01:13:45,526 --> 01:13:46,661
你为什么要监视我？
Why are you spying on me?

1222
01:13:46,794 --> 01:13:48,596
你认识罗曼的兄弟洛基吗？
Did you know Roman's brother Rocky?

1223
01:13:49,530 --> 01:13:52,366
- 不 - 我不相信你
- No. - I don't believe you.

1224
01:13:52,499 --> 01:13:55,636
放手吧
Let it go.

1225
01:13:55,770 --> 01:13:59,140
罗曼认为你们之所以相遇是因为你失去了一个双胞胎
Roman thinks you met because you lost a twin.

1226
01:13:59,273 --> 01:14:01,809
根本不存在的双胞胎
A twin that doesn't even exist.

1227
01:14:01,943 --> 01:14:03,411
你不能对他隐瞒这件事 丹尼斯
You can't keep this from him, Dennis.

1228
01:14:03,544 --> 01:14:04,812
他必须知道真相
He has to know the truth.

1229
01:14:04,946 --> 01:14:06,747
当我准备好时我会告诉他
I will tell him when I'm ready.

1230
01:14:06,881 --> 01:14:08,549
你现在就得告诉他 不然我就告诉他
You need to tell him now or I will.

1231
01:14:08,683 --> 01:14:10,384
你不会告诉他的 玛西
You're not telling him, Marcie.

1232
01:14:10,518 --> 01:14:11,919
我的意思是 上帝 你拥有一切
I mean, God, you have everything.

1233
01:14:12,053 --> 01:14:13,721
每个人都喜欢你 你有一百万个朋友
Everybody likes you, you have a million friends,

1234
01:14:13,854 --> 01:14:15,222
你的父母都有
you have both your parents.

1235
01:14:15,356 --> 01:14:17,325
我敢打赌 你的室内植物永远不会死
I bet none of your houseplants ever fucking die.

1236
01:14:18,259 --> 01:14:19,994
让我拥有一件好东西
Let me have one good thing.

1237
01:14:20,761 --> 01:14:22,596
我很高兴 他也很高兴 我帮助他
I'm happy. He's happy. I help him.

1238
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:24,165
当他凌晨 3 点需要找人聊天时
When he needed somebody to talk to at 3:00

1239
01:14:24,298 --> 01:14:25,833
早上 我接了电话
in the morning, I'm the one who picked up the phone.

1240
01:14:25,967 --> 01:14:27,401
你当时到底在哪儿啊？
Where the fuck were you then, huh?

1241
01:14:27,535 --> 01:14:29,570
如果不是我 你甚至不会认识罗曼
You wouldn't even know Roman if it wasn't for me.

1242
01:14:32,974 --> 01:14:34,842
您希望我做什么？
What do you expect me to do?

1243
01:14:41,215 --> 01:14:43,117
我知道我需要告诉他 我只是……
I know I need to tell him. I just...

1244
01:14:45,219 --> 01:14:46,787
我想要多一点时间
I want a little bit more time.

1245
01:14:48,923 --> 01:14:50,024
请
Please.

1246
01:15:26,293 --> 01:15:28,629
她说她这个周末不能见我
She said she couldn't see me this weekend.

1247
01:15:29,363 --> 01:15:30,965
然后她不停地道歉
Then she kept apologizing

1248
01:15:31,098 --> 01:15:33,200
并说我应该和你谈谈
and said that I should talk to you.

1249
01:15:34,168 --> 01:15:36,470
我的意思是 你确定她什么都没说吗？
I mean, are you sure she didn't say anything?

1250
01:15:38,172 --> 01:15:39,740
哦 你知道吗？我完全忘了
Oh, you know what? I totally forgot

1251
01:15:39,874 --> 01:15:43,544
我们正在为多发性硬化症研究进行全公司范围的筹款活动
we're doing this company-wide fundraiser for MS research,

1252
01:15:43,677 --> 01:15:45,579
玛西发誓保持沉默
and Marcie took a vow of silence.

1253
01:15:46,313 --> 01:15:47,748
- 真的吗？ - 嗯
- Really? - Hmm.

1254
01:15:48,282 --> 01:15:49,717
她为什么不直接告诉我呢？
Why wouldn't she just tell me that?

1255
01:15:50,718 --> 01:15:52,553
我们必须签署保密协议
We had to sign nondisclosure agreements.

1256
01:15:53,354 --> 01:15:54,321
哦
Oh.

1257
01:15:56,023 --> 01:15:56,991
好的
Okay.

1258
01:15:58,527 --> 01:15:59,994
哎呀 我好像想你了
Oops. I guess I missed you.

1259
01:16:00,161 --> 01:16:01,862
我保证尽快给您回电
I promise to call you back ASAP.

1260
01:16:02,029 --> 01:16:03,497
我希望你今天过得愉快
I hope you're having a wonderful day.

1261
01:16:03,631 --> 01:16:05,733
嘿 是我
Hey, it's me.

1262
01:16:06,801 --> 01:16:09,403
只是 呃...我知道你不能说话
Just, uh... I know you can't talk

1263
01:16:09,538 --> 01:16:12,507
因为你在拯救生命
'cause you're saving lives.

1264
01:16:19,914 --> 01:16:21,215
羅馬？
Roman?

1265
01:16:22,517 --> 01:16:24,452
羅馬
Roman.

1266
01:16:25,186 --> 01:16:26,220
嘿
Hey.

1267
01:16:26,353 --> 01:16:27,955
有人打开了波旁威士忌
Someone cracked the bourbon.

1268
01:16:28,557 --> 01:16:29,957
嗯 哦
Mm, ooh.

1269
01:16:30,691 --> 01:16:33,894
好吧 我没有和你一起就开始了 因为我很无聊
Well, I started without you 'cause I was bored.

1270
01:16:34,028 --> 01:16:35,196
我要去洗澡了
I'm gonna hop in the shower.

1271
01:16:35,329 --> 01:16:36,397
不 不要
No, don't.

1272
01:16:36,531 --> 01:16:38,766
你已经丢下我一个人这么久了
You already left me alone for so long.

1273
01:16:39,834 --> 01:16:41,302
噢 哇 你喝醉了
Oh, wow, you are drunk.

1274
01:16:41,435 --> 01:16:42,436
哇
Wow.

1275
01:16:43,337 --> 01:16:44,772

Uh, here.

01:16:44,905 --> 01:16:46,941
我给你倒了一杯
I poured you one.

1277
01:16:48,709 --> 01:16:50,311
我没放任何东西进去
I didn't put anything in it.

1278
01:16:50,444 --> 01:16:53,314
我本来可以的 你永远不知道 你不了解我
I could've though. You never know. You don't know me.

1279
01:16:56,917 --> 01:16:59,153
谢谢
Thanks.

1280
01:17:03,057 --> 01:17:05,159
天哪 这些鞋子真让我难受
God, these fucking shoes are killing me.

1281
01:17:05,292 --> 01:17:07,161
我觉得我的脚变大了
I think my feet got bigger.

1282
01:17:07,294 --> 01:17:09,263
嗯 好吧 你知道那是什么意思
Mmm. Well, you know what that means.

1283
01:17:11,765 --> 01:17:13,434
- 什么？ - 没什么
- What? - Nothing.

1284
01:17:13,568 --> 01:17:14,935
您想做足部按摩吗？
Do you want a foot massage?

1285
01:17:15,069 --> 01:17:17,238
- 呃 不 我没事 - 你确定吗？

我超级好
I'm super good.

1287
01:17:19,073 --> 01:17:21,175
我去按摩培训学校
I went to massage training school

1288
01:17:21,308 --> 01:17:22,776
暑假在大学里
in college in the summer.

1289
01:17:25,446 --> 01:17:27,081

Come on over.

1293
01:17:34,421 --> 01:17:35,956
床很好
The bed is fine.

1294
01:17:40,794 --> 01:17:43,297
- 就像这样？ - 是啊
- Just like this? - Yeah.

1295
01:17:44,899 --> 01:17:47,101
抱歉 哥们 我敢打赌我的脚闻起来像死人
Sorry, man. I bet my foot smells like death.

1296
01:17:47,234 --> 01:17:48,869
嗯 我不介意
Mmm. I don't mind.

1297
01:17:52,973 --> 01:17:54,141
噢 哇哦
Oh, wow.

1298
01:17:56,911 --> 01:17:58,279
哦 该死 你很擅长这个
Oh, shit, you are good at that.

1299
01:17:58,412 --> 01:18:01,982
喝你的饮料就行
Just drink your drink.

1300
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:05,052
好的 抱住你的河马
All right, hold your hippos.

1301
01:18:07,188 --> 01:18:08,389
你说什么？
What did you say?

1302
01:18:10,324 --> 01:18:12,393
“抱住你的河马 ”就像 呃……
"Hold your hippos." It's like, uh...

1303
01:18:13,027 --> 01:18:14,995
就像“稍安勿躁” 但是……
it's like "hold your horses," but...

1304
01:18:15,496 --> 01:18:16,830
这只是我和洛奇说的一句话
It's just something Rocky and I say.

1305
01:18:18,199 --> 01:18:19,166
哦
Oh.

1306
01:18:21,435 --> 01:18:23,304
你和 Dean 有过类似的事情吗？
Did you and Dean ever have anything like that?

1307
01:18:25,507 --> 01:18:26,473
一...
Um...

1308
01:18:28,475 --> 01:18:29,910
“金克丝 你欠我一杯汽水 ”
"Jinx, you owe me a soda."

1309
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:33,380
没错 但每个人都这么说
Right, but everyone says that.

1310
01:18:33,847 --> 01:18:38,018
嗯 我们开始了 是的
Well, we started it. Yeah.

1311
01:18:45,192 --> 01:18:48,329

Ooh. Wow. That's really good.

1313
01:18:55,570 --> 01:18:56,770

1314
01:18:58,072 --> 01:18:59,073

This is actually really helping.

1316
01:19:12,353 --> 01:19:13,555
噢 哇哦
Oh, wow.

1317
01:19:14,355 --> 01:19:18,192
哇 哇 哇 哇 哇 哇 哇
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

1318
01:19:23,864 --> 01:19:26,433
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

1319
01:19:26,568 --> 01:19:28,936
哇 哇 哇 哇 那他妈的是什么？
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What the fuck was that?

1320
01:19:29,069 --> 01:19:32,641
对不起 我不是故意的
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

1321
01:19:32,773 --> 01:19:35,075
我不知道按摩学校里有没有教这个
I don't know if they teach that, like, in-in massage school,

1322
01:19:35,209 --> 01:19:38,078
但我只是 呃 我不喜欢那样 所以……
but I'm just, uh, I'm not into that. So...

1323
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:41,750
抱歉 只是……
I'm sorry. It's just...

1324
01:19:41,882 --> 01:19:44,418
你看上去很像他
You look so much like him.

1325
01:19:44,552 --> 01:19:45,754
像谁？
Like who?

1326
01:19:45,886 --> 01:19:47,921
哦 我不想让你恨我
Oh, I don't want you to hate me.

1327
01:19:48,055 --> 01:19:49,758
我不恨你 这没什么大不了的 你知道吗？
I don't hate you. It's not a big deal, you know?

1328
01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:51,292
只是不要再这样做了
Just don't do it again.

1329
01:19:51,425 --> 01:19:54,295
是的 如果我告诉你 你会恨我的
Yeah, if I tell you, you're gonna hate me,

1330
01:19:54,428 --> 01:19:56,397
然后一切都会结束
and then it's gonna be over.

1331
01:19:56,531 --> 01:19:59,166
你在说什么？我……我为什么要恨你？
What are you talking about? Why... why would I hate you?

1332
01:20:01,569 --> 01:20:03,003
因为 嗯...
Because, um...

1333
01:20:04,204 --> 01:20:06,675
我没有双胞胎 而且迪恩也不是真实存在的
I don't have a twin, and Dean isn't real.

1334
01:20:07,941 --> 01:20:08,909
什么 -
Wha--

1335
01:20:10,578 --> 01:20:12,681
你什么意思？他不是真的 是什么意思？
What do you mean? What do you mean he isn't real?

1336
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:16,518
我虚构了他 他根本不存在
I made him up. He doesn't exist.

1337
01:20:18,419 --> 01:20:20,154
你到底在说什么？
What the fuck are you talking about?

1338
01:20:20,622 --> 01:20:22,189
您为什么加入支持小组？
Why are you in the support group?

1339
01:20:22,323 --> 01:20:24,825
我刚刚开始关注你
I just started following you.

1340
01:20:25,392 --> 01:20:28,362
我以为这是一个征兆 我一直试图告诉你
I thought it was a sign, and I kept trying to tell you,

1341
01:20:28,495 --> 01:20:30,931
但是我——我的意思是 你怎么说……
but I-- I mean, how do you say...

1342
01:20:31,065 --> 01:20:32,833
哦 我爱上你的哥哥了
Oh, I was in love with your brother.

1343
01:20:32,966 --> 01:20:34,602
但那并不是真正的爱情 因为我只认识他
Except it wasn't really love because I only knew him

1344
01:20:34,736 --> 01:20:36,638
一天 但当时 感觉已经足够了 而且……
for a day, but at the time, that felt like enough, and...

1345
01:20:36,771 --> 01:20:39,507
我是那个在十字路口的疯狂家伙
And I was the crazy guy in-in the intersection,

1346
01:20:39,641 --> 01:20:41,141
你知道 严格来说这不是我的错
and, you know, it wasn't technically my fault,

1347
01:20:41,275 --> 01:20:42,777
但如果他从未遇见我 他可能还活着
but if he never met me, he'd probably still be alive,

1348
01:20:42,910 --> 01:20:44,945
那是我一生中最糟糕的一天 而且……
and it was the worst day of my life and...

1349
01:20:45,079 --> 01:20:46,380
我不知道为什么我一直撒谎
I don't know why I kept lying.

1350
01:20:46,514 --> 01:20:48,449
我只是...我想靠近你
I just... I wanted to be close to you,

1351
01:20:48,583 --> 01:20:49,718
我认为我可以做得更好
and I thought I could make it better,

1352
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:51,051
但我只是让事情变得更糟
but I just kept making things worse.

1353
01:20:51,185 --> 01:20:52,687
而且 Marcie 并没有选择默默隐居
And-and Marcie isn't on a silent retreat,

1354
01:20:52,821 --> 01:20:55,690
而且我...我没有上过按摩学校 但是...
and I... I didn't go to massage school, but...

1355
01:20:55,824 --> 01:20:58,492
你是我最好的朋友
You are my best friend.

1356
01:20:59,293 --> 01:21:02,496
我不希望这种情况发生改变
And I don't want that to change.

1357
01:21:07,101 --> 01:21:08,636
我不知道该怎么办
I don't know what to do.

1358
01:21:11,105 --> 01:21:12,339
你恨我嗎？
Do you hate me?

1359
01:21:15,844 --> 01:21:18,979
罗曼？请说点什么
Roman? Please say something.

1360
01:21:20,013 --> 01:21:24,552
罗曼 你恨我吗？
Roman. Do you hate me?

1361
01:21:26,186 --> 01:21:27,555
别他妈的碰我
Don't fucking touch me.

1362
01:21:27,689 --> 01:21:29,657
罗曼 求你了 我……我很抱歉
Roman, please. I... I'm sorry.

1363
01:21:29,791 --> 01:21:31,892
别他妈碰我！
Don't fucking touch me!

1364
01:22:14,736 --> 01:22:16,871
我只是不停地打他
I just kept hitting him.

1365
01:22:18,873 --> 01:22:20,140
停不下来
Couldn't stop.

1366
01:22:39,694 --> 01:22:41,863
嗨 丹尼斯 我是玛西
Hi, Dennis. It's Marcie.

1367
01:22:42,029 --> 01:22:45,299
你没上班 Sage 让我给你打电话
So you're not at work. Sage asked me to call you.

1368
01:22:45,432 --> 01:22:47,234
你今天会来吗？
Are you coming in today?

1369
01:22:47,301 --> 01:22:49,871
瞧 罗曼非常沮丧
Look, Roman's pretty upset.

1370
01:22:50,037 --> 01:22:51,573
他希望你不要再给他打电话
He wants you to stop calling him,

1371
01:22:51,739 --> 01:22:53,474
他也不想让我和你说话
and he doesn't want me talking to you either,

1372
01:22:53,641 --> 01:22:55,309
但我会想着你
but I'll be thinking of you.

1373
01:23:02,449 --> 01:23:04,886
你看到什么了吗...我看到了什么？
Do you see what... I see?

1374
01:23:05,052 --> 01:23:09,122
我不知道你看到了什么 但我看到的就是我
I don't know what you see, but what I see is me.

1375
01:23:09,289 --> 01:23:10,424
我也看到我了
I see me too.

1376
01:23:10,592 --> 01:23:12,961
这是否意味着你们有两个人
Does that mean there's two of you

1377
01:23:13,126 --> 01:23:15,128
或者...或者我两个？
or... or two of me?

1378
01:23:19,667 --> 01:23:20,635
哦
Oh.

1379
01:23:23,136 --> 01:23:24,739
哇
Wow.

1380
01:23:24,906 --> 01:23:27,007
我们确实有两个人
There really is two of us.

1381
01:23:27,140 --> 01:23:28,810
你不觉得这很奇怪吗？
Don't you find this odd?

1382
01:23:28,977 --> 01:23:31,178
不 这很奇怪
No, this is weird.

1383
01:23:31,345 --> 01:23:34,716
这真的非常非常奇怪
This is really, really weird.

1384
01:23:34,782 --> 01:23:38,085
等一下 你住在卡拉威家
Wait a sec. You live at the Callaway house.

1385
01:23:38,252 --> 01:23:40,955
你就是那个来自营地的女孩
And you're that girl from camp.

1386
01:23:41,088 --> 01:23:43,457
他们以为我就是你！
They thought I was you!

1387
01:23:44,626 --> 01:23:46,828
那么今天谁想开始呢？
So who'd like to start today?

1388
01:23:54,434 --> 01:23:57,371
好吧 如果没有人说 那么我就说吧
Okay, if no one's gonna say it, then I'll say it.

1389
01:23:57,504 --> 01:24:01,041
Roman 给我们发了一封电子邮件 说你编造了 Dean
Roman sent us all an email that said you made Dean up,

1390
01:24:01,174 --> 01:24:02,911
我觉得你就是个讨厌鬼
and I think that you're a fucking creep.

1391
01:24:03,043 --> 01:24:05,345
这是真的吗 丹尼斯？
Is this true, Dennis?

1392
01:24:11,385 --> 01:24:14,054
真的吗？呃 我是说……
True? Uh, I mean...

1393
01:24:14,187 --> 01:24:16,824
从技术上来说...确实如此
Technically... it's true,

1394
01:24:16,958 --> 01:24:19,827
但我一直感觉和你们所有人如此亲近
but I-I've always felt so connected to all of you,

1395
01:24:19,961 --> 01:24:22,496
我一直想要一个双胞胎
and I've always wanted a twin.

1396
01:24:22,630 --> 01:24:25,265
有时 迪恩会感到真实
Sometimes Dean felt real.

1397
01:24:25,833 --> 01:24:27,669
他最喜欢的零食是热椒盐卷饼
His favorite snack is a hot pretzel

1398
01:24:27,802 --> 01:24:29,269
加海盐和……
with sea salt and...

1399
01:24:29,971 --> 01:24:33,206
你知道 双胞胎身份可能只是一种构造
You know, maybe twin identity is really just a construct,

1400
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:35,877
比如性别
like gender.

1401
01:24:36,010 --> 01:24:39,714
哦 好吧 或者可能不是 嗯……
Oh, okay. Or it's maybe not. Um...

1402
01:24:42,482 --> 01:24:45,753
我正在阅读有关消失的双胞胎综合症的文章
I was reading about vanishing twin syndrome.

1403
01:24:46,654 --> 01:24:48,056
因为我一直认为
Because I've always thought

1404
01:24:48,188 --> 01:24:51,025
有什么东西或某个人失踪了
there was something or someone missing.

1405
01:24:51,659 --> 01:24:57,230
我妈妈肚子里可能还有一个双胞胎
And it's possible that I had a twin in my mother's womb,

1406
01:24:57,364 --> 01:24:59,132
但我吃了他
but I ate him.

1407
01:24:59,934 --> 01:25:03,538
我想问她 但我不能 因为她已经死了
And I'd ask her, but I can't because she's dead.

1408
01:25:04,404 --> 01:25:06,139
真的死了 她是真实存在的
Really dead. She's real.

1409
01:25:08,375 --> 01:25:10,410
我们相信你有妈妈
We believe you got a mom.

1410
01:25:12,179 --> 01:25:13,280
我不知道
I don't.

1411
01:25:48,616 --> 01:25:50,652
打扰一下 你能给我们拍张照吗？
Excuse me. Can you take a picture of us?

1412
01:25:52,386 --> 01:25:55,657
不 不 我不能 你不知道自己有多幸运
No. No, I can't. You have no idea how lucky you are.

1413
01:25:55,790 --> 01:25:57,825
嗯 很抱歉我们问了这个问题
Well, sorry we asked.

1414
01:26:09,302 --> 01:26:10,470
他妈的
Fuck.

1415
01:26:14,108 --> 01:26:15,677
你要买什么？
What are you looking for?

1416
01:26:15,810 --> 01:26:18,311
我找不到洛奇的毛衣 呃……
I can't find Rocky's sweater. Uh...

1417
01:26:19,346 --> 01:26:21,716
有条纹的那个 那个……
The one with the-- with the stripes, the...

1418
01:26:21,849 --> 01:26:23,316
你把它移走了吗？你把它放到别处了吗？
Did you move it? Did you put it somewhere?

1419
01:26:23,450 --> 01:26:24,719
不 我没有碰它
No, I didn't touch it.

1420
01:26:25,987 --> 01:26:28,221
我敢打赌丹尼斯偷了它 那个假双胞胎
I bet Dennis stole it, that fake twin fucker.

1421
01:26:29,757 --> 01:26:30,792
我确信它会出现
I'm sure it'll turn up.

1422
01:26:30,925 --> 01:26:32,359
是啊 你怎么知道的？
Yeah, how the fuck do you know that?

1423
01:26:37,131 --> 01:26:38,066
对不起
I'm sorry.

1424
01:26:38,198 --> 01:26:39,167
你不能这样跟我说话
You can't talk to me like that.

1425
01:26:39,299 --> 01:26:40,735
我知道 对不起
I know. I'm sorry.

1426
01:26:41,468 --> 01:26:43,236
对不起 对不起
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1427
01:26:46,974 --> 01:26:48,176
我原谅你
I forgive you.

1428
01:26:51,145 --> 01:26:52,547
我不值得
I don't deserve it.

1429
01:26:54,716 --> 01:26:57,484
应得的惩罚并不是获得宽恕的必要条件
Deservedness is not a requisite for forgiveness.

1430
01:27:03,457 --> 01:27:05,560
我帮你看看
I'll help you look.

1431
01:27:44,098 --> 01:27:46,200
- 现在不行 - 什么时候？
- Not right now. - When?

1432
01:27:48,102 --> 01:27:51,239
- 再过三十分钟 - 你三十分钟前就这么说了
- Thirty more minutes. - You said that 30 minutes ago.

1433
01:27:51,371 --> 01:27:54,374
好吧 想象一下
Well, think of it like

1434
01:27:55,176 --> 01:27:58,378
边缘
edging.

1435
01:28:02,917 --> 01:28:05,987
哦 不
Oh, no.

1436
01:28:16,531 --> 01:28:18,398
今晚你想吃什么？
What do you want to do for dinner tonight?

1437
01:28:18,533 --> 01:28:20,134
哦 我要去雪莉家 记得吗？
Oh, I'm going to Shelly's, remember?

1438
01:28:20,802 --> 01:28:23,237
哦 忘了
Oh. Forgot.

1439
01:28:26,741 --> 01:28:27,775
我可以来吗？
Can I come?

1440
01:28:28,308 --> 01:28:29,744
这是女生之夜
It's girls' night.

1441
01:28:29,877 --> 01:28:32,412
- 我们讨论过这个 - 好的 很好
- We talked about this. - Okay. Fine.

1442
01:28:32,547 --> 01:28:35,750
- 别闷闷不乐  - 我没有闷闷不乐
- Don't mope. - I'm not moping.

1443
01:29:22,597 --> 01:29:24,497
抱歉 有人排队
Sorry, there was a line.

1444
01:29:24,632 --> 01:29:25,733
我不能久留
I can't stay long.

1445
01:29:31,606 --> 01:29:33,307
- 谢谢 - 当然
- Thank you. - Sure thing.

1446
01:29:34,876 --> 01:29:36,711
抱歉 我不应该点任何东西
Sorry, I shouldn't have ordered anything.

1447
01:29:38,779 --> 01:29:41,148
- 你想要我的三明治吗？ - 不 我很好
- Do you want my sandwich? - No, I'm good.

1448
01:29:51,893 --> 01:29:53,928
- 我升职了 哦 - 你好吗？
- I got a promotion. Oh. - How are you?

1449
01:29:54,896 --> 01:29:55,863
恭喜
Congrats.

1450
01:29:56,831 --> 01:30:00,368
谢谢 算是吧 这是阶梯式的移动
Thanks. Sort of. It's a ladder move.

1451
01:30:01,669 --> 01:30:02,870
横向移动？
Lateral move?

1452
01:30:03,738 --> 01:30:06,040
- 什么？ - 侧面
- What? - Lateral.

1453
01:30:06,173 --> 01:30:07,875
意味着你正在横向移动
Means you're moving sideways.

1454
01:30:08,509 --> 01:30:09,710
我想你可以有一个侧梯
I guess you could have a sideways ladder,

1455
01:30:09,844 --> 01:30:11,879
但我想不出它有什么用途
but I can't think of a use for it.

1456
01:30:13,547 --> 01:30:14,515
他妈的
Fuck.

1457
01:30:16,050 --> 01:30:18,586
我对很多人说过“梯子移动”
I said "ladder move" to, like, so many people.

1458
01:30:20,688 --> 01:30:23,624
嗯 单杠 那是一种侧向的梯子
Well, monkey bars. That's a sideways ladder.

1459
01:30:24,258 --> 01:30:25,226
伟大的
Great.

1460
01:30:29,563 --> 01:30:32,133
那么你最近在哪儿工作？玛西说你辞职了
So where you working these days? Marcie said you quit.

1461
01:30:32,767 --> 01:30:34,902
虽然被解雇了 但她还是很善良
Fired, but that's sweet of her.

1462
01:30:35,036 --> 01:30:37,705
我正在办理房地产执照
I'm in the process of getting my real estate license.

1463
01:30:41,242 --> 01:30:42,977
什么 没有书籍设计？
What, no book designing?

1464
01:30:43,110 --> 01:30:45,646
我决定宁愿做一个不快乐的中产阶级
I decided I'd rather be middle class and unhappy

1465
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:48,616
比贫穷的人少一些 但不幸程度却略低一些
than poor and slightly less unhappy.

1466
01:30:48,749 --> 01:30:51,085
是的 很有道理
Yeah. Makes sense.

1467
01:30:51,686 --> 01:30:52,954
话虽如此 我确实……
And that said, I did...

1468
01:30:57,525 --> 01:31:00,261
不确定这是否品味低下 但是......
Wasn't sure if it was in poor taste or not, but...

1469
01:31:05,199 --> 01:31:07,134
我认为这绝对是低级趣味
Think it's definitely poor taste.

1470
01:31:09,070 --> 01:31:10,604
是的 我现在明白了
Yeah, I can see that now.

1471
01:31:11,272 --> 01:31:13,140
- 我可以接受... - 不 不 我会...
- I can take it... - No, no, I'll...

1472
01:31:13,274 --> 01:31:16,177
我会保留它
I'll keep it.

1473
01:31:24,484 --> 01:31:25,953
我打断了你的胳膊吗？
Did I break your arm?

1474
01:31:26,988 --> 01:31:29,623
呃 没关系 算是吧
Uh, unrelated. Sort of.

1475
01:31:31,158 --> 01:31:32,126
对不起
Sorry.

1476
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:34,595
因为我曾经打过你
For hitting you like I did.

1477
01:31:37,431 --> 01:31:38,666
没关系
It's all right.

1478
01:31:38,799 --> 01:31:40,935
不 不是这样的 我不应该这么做
No, it's not. I shouldn't have done that.

1479
01:31:42,937 --> 01:31:44,839
我认为我在这方面比你强
I think I outclassed you in that department.

1480
01:31:47,274 --> 01:31:48,976
是的 我只是不 嗯......

我不明白怎么会有人……

我的意思是 你是谁？
I mean, who are you?

1483
01:32:03,090 --> 01:32:05,459
你知道人们怎么说“做你自己”吗？
You know how people say "just be yourself"?

1484

Like, what version of me? I hate most of them.

我一直想成为他
I wanted to be him all the time.

1487

那么 你——
So, you--

1488
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:36,590
你说你爱上了洛克
you said you were in love with Rock.

1489
01:32:38,192 --> 01:32:39,927
但我要声明 我疯了
With the caveat that I am insane.

1490
01:32:41,495 --> 01:32:43,064
他曾经谈论过我吗？

所以我不能久留
So I can't stay long.

1495
01:33:05,352 --> 01:33:06,754
对 你说
Right. You said.

1496
01:33:09,690 --> 01:33:10,958
顺便问一下 玛西怎么样了？
How is Marcie, by the way?

1497
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:14,061
在 Marcie-land 每天都是好日子
Every day is a good day in Marcie-land.

1498
01:33:14,195 --> 01:33:16,197
我记得
I remember.

1499
01:33:23,704 --> 01:33:25,739
我就吃一口
I'll just have a bite.

1500
01:33:25,873 --> 01:33:28,776
唔
Hmm.

我们班上有个瘦子 让我想起了你
There's a skinny guy in my class, reminds me of you.

1503
01:33:39,420 --> 01:33:41,055
这些课程不是没用吗？
Aren't those classes useless?

1504
01:33:41,556 --> 01:33:43,724
我听说只有在街头才能真正学会如何打架
I hear you can only really learn how to fight in the streets.

1505
01:33:45,793 --> 01:33:47,328
嗯 我们也在街上学习
Well, we learn in the streets too.

你觉得我们会成为朋友吗
Do you think we would've been friends

1508
01:34:01,442 --> 01:34:03,110
如果我们在不同的情况下相遇呢？
if we met under different circumstances?

1509
01:34:15,557 --> 01:34:16,490
我不知道
I don't know.

1510
01:34:18,292 --> 01:34:19,693
我希望如此 但是……
I'd like to think so, but...

1511
01:34:21,829 --> 01:34:22,763
正确的
Right.

1512
01:34:27,935 --> 01:34:29,870
天啊 这个演员阵容太让人心痒了

洛奇说你自己的脚曾经被摔断过
