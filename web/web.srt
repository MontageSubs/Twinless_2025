你更像是在帮倒忙
It feels like you're doing the opposite of your job

现在七点了 我们开始吧
It's seven o'clock, so I say let's get started.

48
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:56,671
我发现今天有一些新面孔
I see some new faces here today,

49
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:59,707
所以我想大家来做一个有趣的绕圈自我介绍
so I thought it would be fun to go in a circle.

50
00:03:59,841 --> 00:04:01,241
说出你的名字
Say your name,

51
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:04,411
名字首字母相同的蔬菜

52
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:08,716
还有 别怀念你的同胞胎了

00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:16,624
我一点也不怀念克莱尔抢了我的男朋友那事
I don't miss Claire stealing my boyfriend.

55
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:19,026
别当真 我开玩笑的
No, I'm kidding.

56
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,728
我开玩笑的 我们不搞绕圈自我介绍
I'm kidding. We won't go in a circle.

57
00:04:20,862 --> 00:04:23,064
但是克莱尔确实抢了我的男朋友
But Claire, she really did steal my boyfriend.

58
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:26,868
他分不清我们俩 不过还是可以算她抢的 对吧？
He couldn't tell us apart. But it still counts, right?

59
00:04:30,171 --> 00:04:31,806
我怀念她的笑声
I miss her laugh.

60
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:35,109
我们以前总是一起笑

我们还说要模仿艾伯特和科斯特洛来一段双人喜剧
We talked about doing this Abbott and Costello routine.

62
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:41,448
但我太害羞了
But I was too shy.

63
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:45,086
所以我对自己说：那我试试单口喜剧好了
So, I said to myself I'll try stand-up.

64
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:48,790
没错 现在我就要在你们身上试试笑话
Yep, and I'm about to test jokes on you,

65
00:04:48,923 --> 00:04:50,390
请多包涵
so bear with me.

66
00:04:51,192 --> 00:04:53,426
准备好了吗？好
Okay, you ready? All right.

67
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:55,963
有双胞胎的请举手
Raise your hand if you have a twin.

很多人总喜欢问
You know, so many people, they're always asking,

71
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:05,173
“谁大一些？”
"Who's older?"

72
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,842
现在我大一些 因为她已经死了
I am now that she's dead.

73
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,746
作为双胞胎 你会把你和另一半的差异都刻在心里
As a twin, it's like you internalize the difference

74
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,781
你和你的另一半之间
between you and your other half.

75
00:05:13,915 --> 00:05:16,851
克莱尔外向些 克莱尔漂亮些
Claire's the outgoing one, Claire's the beautiful one,

76
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,352
克莱尔感染了衣原体

我很伤心
I was so upset

78
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:23,825
她感染衣原体时我不在
when she got chlamydia without me.

79
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:28,629
毕竟我们什么都该一起做的嘛
We're supposed to do everything together.

It's weird, isn't it?

93
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:29,757
呃 表观遗传学
Uh, epigenetics.

94
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:33,861
- 呃... - 它们是你从基因中继承的
- Uh... - They're the things you inherit on top of your DNA.

95
00:06:33,995 --> 00:06:36,264
它们可能会表达偏差
They may account for discrepancies

96
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,932
同卵双胞胎之间
between identical twins.

97
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:39,700

00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:46,107
洛奇总是坐在前排
Rocky always had to sit in the front seat

101
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,576
当我们还是孩子的时候 并且...
when we were kids, and...

102
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:50,077
我不知道 我只是觉得
I don't know, I just thought

103
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:53,614
这可能与同性恋基因有关
maybe that was connected to, like, the gay gene.

104
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:55,415
如果有的话
If there is one.

105
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:58,052
并不是说有这样的人
Not that there is one.

106
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:01,756
呃 这只是个想法 我不是科学家

对 是有同性恋基因
Um, well, there is a gay gene.

That's why there's so many homosexuals

110
