1
00:01:10,505 --> 00:01:11,438
Yep.

2
00:01:14,676 --> 00:01:16,511
Hi. I'm Judy.

3
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:18,613
- Roman. - I worked with Rocky.

4
00:01:20,048 --> 00:01:21,583
Sorry.

5
00:01:21,716 --> 00:01:25,419
It's like looking at a ghost. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

6
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:27,354
Have to get out of here.

7
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:29,456
Roman. Eric.

8
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:33,093
We've never met, but I feel like I know you.

9
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:34,896
I'm so sorry for your loss.

10
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:37,966
I'm-I'm here if you...

11
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,702
Oh, God. Your face.

12
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,081
It doesn't-- Actually, it doesn't seem like

13
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:29,249
you are trying to do your job. No, looks like--

14
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:30,918
It feels like you're doing the opposite of your job

15
00:02:31,052 --> 00:02:32,419
'cause it should be pretty easy to cancel

16
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:34,022
- my dead brother's account. - Do you want this?

17
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,455
- I don't know. - Ma, I don't know.

18
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,925
I'm on the phone. No, do not put me on hold!

19
00:02:38,059 --> 00:02:40,293
- Do you want these? - I-- Mom, please.

20
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:42,162
Don't tell me to fucking calm down!

21
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,197
I've been on the phone for, like, an hour--

22
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:47,101
- Hello? Fuck! - Roman,

23
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:48,970
do you want me to keep these or throw them away?

24
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:51,039
- Do we have to do this now? - We don't have the room,

25
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,439
but if you wanna keep everything--

26
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:54,207
Can we just do this tomorrow, please? Why?

27
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,643
Because I'm going back tomorrow.

28
00:02:55,777 --> 00:02:57,210
Okay, but I'm gonna be here, so just leave it.

29
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,780
You're gonna pack up this entire apartment?

30
00:02:58,913 --> 00:03:00,213
- Yes. Yes. - Oh, that's rich.

31
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,649
I'll do it myself-- What?

32
00:03:01,783 --> 00:03:03,618
I don't think you should stay here. I don't think

33
00:03:03,751 --> 00:03:05,185
- it's good for you. - Oh, come on. You don't know

34
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:06,854
what's good for me, Mom. You never knew

35
00:03:06,988 --> 00:03:08,355
- what was good for me. Okay? - All right.

36
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:09,891
- You kidding me? - Well, then never mind.

37
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:11,526
- I won't help you. - Good.

38
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:13,061
- You can do all this yourself. - That's what I'm saying.

39
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,529
- That's-- Go. - I'll go back to the hotel.

40
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:15,830
- Don't call me. - Good. Good for fucking you!

41
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:17,999
Time-out!

42
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:22,837
Roman.

43
00:03:24,706 --> 00:03:26,206
You need help.

44
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:28,743
You need help.

45
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,546
Well, that's true.

46
00:03:49,197 --> 00:03:50,598
Hello, everyone.

47
00:03:50,732 --> 00:03:53,901
It's seven o'clock, so I say let's get started.

48
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:56,671
I see some new faces here today,

49
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:59,707
so I thought it would be fun to go in a circle.

50
00:03:59,841 --> 00:04:01,241
Say your name,

51
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:04,411
a vegetable that starts with the same first letter

52
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:08,716
and one thing you don't miss about your twin.

53
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,086
Charlotte. Carrot.

54
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:16,624
I don't miss Claire stealing my boyfriend.

55
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:19,026
No, I'm kidding.

56
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,728
I'm kidding. We won't go in a circle.

57
00:04:20,862 --> 00:04:23,064
But Claire, she really did steal my boyfriend.

58
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:26,868
He couldn't tell us apart. But it still counts, right?

59
00:04:30,171 --> 00:04:31,806
I miss her laugh.

60
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:35,109
We always laughed together.

61
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:39,412
We talked about doing this Abbott and Costello routine.

62
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:41,448
But I was too shy.

63
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:45,086
So, I said to myself I'll try stand-up.

64
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:48,790
Yep, and I'm about to test jokes on you,

65
00:04:48,923 --> 00:04:50,390
so bear with me.

66
00:04:51,192 --> 00:04:53,426
Okay, you ready? All right.

67
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:55,963
Raise your hand if you have a twin.

68
00:04:56,097 --> 00:04:58,733
Okay.

69
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:00,735
This is a good crowd.

70
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:03,504
You know, so many people, they're always asking,

71
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:05,173
"Who's older?"

72
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,842
I am now that she's dead.

73
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,746
As a twin, it's like you internalize the difference

74
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,781
between you and your other half.

75
00:05:13,915 --> 00:05:16,851
Claire's the outgoing one, Claire's the beautiful one,

76
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,352
Claire's the one with chlamydia.

77
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,155
I was so upset

78
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:23,825
when she got chlamydia without me.

79
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:28,629
We're supposed to do everything together.

80
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:51,118
Oh, I wouldn't eat that. Tastes like balls.

81
00:05:52,587 --> 00:05:55,723
Mm, I like balls.

82
00:05:55,857 --> 00:05:56,791
Oh.

83
00:05:58,292 --> 00:05:59,727
Mm.

84
00:05:59,861 --> 00:06:03,363
Oh, my God, that's so bad.

85
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:06,901
Are you, uh...

86
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,803
Am I...?

87
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:11,539
Oh, just-- You said you like balls, so...

88
00:06:13,975 --> 00:06:16,510
Rocky, my brother, was gay.

89
00:06:18,346 --> 00:06:19,680
Was your twin?

90
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:22,650
Um... No.

91
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:24,185
Right.

92
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,888
It's weird, isn't it?

93
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:29,757
Uh, epigenetics.

94
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:33,861
- Uh... - They're the things you inherit on top of your DNA.

95
00:06:33,995 --> 00:06:36,264
They may account for discrepancies

96
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,932
between identical twins.

97
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:39,700
Huh.

98
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:41,502
Hey, do you get carsick?

99
00:06:42,036 --> 00:06:44,105
- Sometimes. Why? - Oh.

100
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:46,107
Rocky always had to sit in the front seat

101
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,576
when we were kids, and...

102
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:50,077
I don't know, I just thought

103
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:53,614
maybe that was connected to, like, the gay gene.

104
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:55,415
If there is one.

105
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:58,052
Not that there is one.

106
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:01,756
Uh, it was just an idea. I'm no scientist.

107
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:05,293
Um, well, there is a gay gene.

108
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,229
Uh, we see orange as blue and blue as orange.

109
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:10,097
That's why there's so many homosexuals

110
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:12,432
- in the fashion industry. - Oh. See?

111
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:15,403
Well, there you go.

112
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,272
I'm sorry, you know that I'm joking, right?

113
00:07:18,406 --> 00:07:19,807
That-that's not true.

114
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:23,311
Yeah. No, I knew that.

115
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:25,478
Okay.

116
00:07:27,882 --> 00:07:29,984
I'm D-- uh, I'm Dennis.

117
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,919
Roman.

118
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:40,895
- What was your twin's name? - Are you hungry?

119
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:42,596
- Sorry, what? - Sorry. I was just gonna ask

120
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,432
if you like sandwiches. Never mind.

121
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:54,809
You sure you don't want some?

122
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:56,310
Mm, I'm okay.

123
00:07:56,444 --> 00:07:58,346
- I forgot I already ate. - Mm.

124
00:08:04,452 --> 00:08:07,955
I don't drink caffeine 'cause it does things to me.

125
00:08:08,723 --> 00:08:11,792
Then Brad converted me to tea. Herbal tea.

126
00:08:11,926 --> 00:08:14,695
Brad was this guy I was in love with back in New York.

127
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:16,597
Then one day, I found all these goat-fucking videos

128
00:08:16,731 --> 00:08:18,532
- in his browser history. - Whoa.

129
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,701
I tried to get him to confess, but I avoid conflict,

130
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:23,771
so at dinner, I'd order goat cheese on an entrée,

131
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:28,042
or one time when he was sucking on my neck, I bleated like...

132
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:34,181
See how he'd react. So, I know he knew I knew.

133
00:08:34,315 --> 00:08:36,050
Maybe that's why he broke up with me.

134
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:37,451
He broke up with you?

135
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:39,453
Mm. He was the better catch.

136
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:43,791
I don't know anything about Rocky's boyfriends.

137
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:46,227
We didn't really talk about that stuff.

138
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,162
What stuff did you talk about?

139
00:08:49,497 --> 00:08:50,531
Socks.

140
00:08:51,165 --> 00:08:54,468
- Socks? - I get holes in all my socks.

141
00:08:54,602 --> 00:08:57,204
I think it's 'cause I forget to cut my toenails.

142
00:08:57,338 --> 00:08:59,673
Rocky thinks it's 'cause I shop at Walmart.

143
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:03,512
That was our last conversation.

144
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,981
I'm sorry.

145
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:08,349
Not your fault.

146
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,760
So, did you live with your brother?

147
00:09:20,361 --> 00:09:23,164
Uh, no. Yeah, in college.

148
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:26,667
Mm. Rocky went to college. I stayed in Moscow.

149
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:28,736
Moscow, Idaho?

150
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:30,771
You know another one?

151
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:33,240
Another Moscow?

152
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:38,112
I need to get out of my mom's basement.

153
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,281
She started charging me rent.

154
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,450
Hmm. And how's she taking it?

155
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,851
Cash.

156
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,755
How is she feeling?

157
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:49,457
She's a nut bucket.

158
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,527
Rocky was her favorite, so...

159
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,463
Mm. I'm nobody's favorite.

160
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,533
Feel like being a twin kind of fucked me.

161
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,803
I never needed anyone else as a kid, you know, but now...

162
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:06,774
feel like I can't make friends with a fork.

163
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:09,710
Once, twice a week's not enough.

164
00:10:09,844 --> 00:10:12,547
I want to hang out all the time. I'm-I'm too needy.

165
00:10:13,548 --> 00:10:15,316
I hate doing things alone.

166
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:18,085
Cooking meals, opening mail,

167
00:10:18,219 --> 00:10:19,453
- folding laundry. - Yeah.

168
00:10:19,588 --> 00:10:21,155
So much faster with two people.

169
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,423
Right? I mean, honestly,

170
00:10:22,557 --> 00:10:23,757
whoever invented the fitted sheet

171
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:25,893
should be flagellated. And not the fun kind.

172
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:30,297
You get me.

173
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:52,820
Rocky!

174
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:57,258
Long time no see. How are you? Did you get a haircut?

175
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:59,160
Oh. Uh, yeah.

176
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:00,595
This is so random.

177
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:02,863
I was literally thinking about you the other day.

178
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:05,634
I was reading an article about how there's a Japanese word

179
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,468
for people who die in their apartments...

180
00:11:07,602 --> 00:11:09,436
- Mm. - ...and it takes a long time

181
00:11:09,571 --> 00:11:12,006
for anyone to find the body-- Years even.

182
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:13,474
Old men mostly.

183
00:11:13,608 --> 00:11:15,876
It's like a big problem over there.

184
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,278
Ah, that's awful.

185
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:18,379
Isn't it?

186
00:11:19,113 --> 00:11:21,048
Anyway, I figured you knew this already

187
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:24,151
because you used to live in Tokyo, right?

188
00:11:24,285 --> 00:11:25,319
Right. Yeah.

189
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:27,622
Yeah, what is the word again?

190
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:29,823
Oh, uh...

191
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,562
"Ahtoatushi."

192
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,566
That doesn't sound right.

193
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,928
<i>Hello?</i>

194
00:12:08,062 --> 00:12:10,397
Hey. It's Roman.

195
00:12:10,965 --> 00:12:12,601
Do you wanna get groceries with me?

196
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:24,845
Hey, how do you know if lemons are ripe?

197
00:12:24,979 --> 00:12:27,281
Uh, it's yellow. Unripe lemons are green.

198
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:30,417
So why do they got so many unripe ones out?

199
00:12:30,552 --> 00:12:33,020
Those are limes.

200
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:46,267
Uh...

201
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:48,536
Are you okay?

202
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,739
Can you not laugh at me?

203
00:12:51,405 --> 00:12:53,941
I know I'm not, like, the brightest tool in the shed,

204
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:56,477
but... I don't appreciate it.

205
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,480
Yeah. Yeah, of course. I'm sorry.

206
00:12:59,614 --> 00:13:02,149
You know, if I get something wrong... tell me.

207
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:05,052
'Cause... then I can know better.

208
00:13:09,123 --> 00:13:10,592
Would now be a good time to point out

209
00:13:10,725 --> 00:13:12,993
I think you meant to say, "sharpest tool in the shed?"

210
00:13:16,765 --> 00:13:18,432
Yeah.

211
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:22,436
Maybe you meant to say, "brightest bulb in the box."

212
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,104
- Yeah, maybe that's what I meant. - Yeah, yeah.

213
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:04,945
Hey.

214
00:14:06,781 --> 00:14:08,148
Uh, sorry.

215
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:11,051
I haven't been sleeping well, so...

216
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:12,386
Oh.

217
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,154
Hey, is that Rocky's shirt?

218
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:16,890
Oh, yeah, yeah. How'd you know?

219
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:18,727
- Looks good on you. - Thanks.

220
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:21,862
What, uh, what are we looking for?

221
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:24,965
Oh, just browsing. I pick books based on the cover.

222
00:14:25,633 --> 00:14:27,234
I thought you weren't supposed to do that.

223
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:29,804
You're also not supposed to put Q-tips in your ear,

224
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:32,406
but if you do it right, it feels really good.

225
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:02,970
<i>I don't know why I'm doing this</i>

226
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:04,471
<i>'cause nobody's ever gonna hear it.</i>

227
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,241
<i>I answered a call from an unknown number once,</i>

228
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:10,377
<i>and he said, "Hey, I was thinking about you."</i>

229
00:15:10,545 --> 00:15:11,780
<i>"What are you doing tonight?"</i>

230
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:13,581
<i>And we baked...</i>

231
00:15:14,582 --> 00:15:15,784
Hey.

232
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:19,153
Think I'm gonna stay.

233
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:21,455
- What? - Yeah. Lawyer says,

234
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:23,792
the probate's gonna take a little while anyway.

235
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:26,059
Plus, Rocky's boss offered me a job.

236
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:29,463
Uh, he was crying a lot, but I think he was serious.

237
00:15:29,597 --> 00:15:30,565
Hmm.

238
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:34,101
Feel like I need to be here right now.

239
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:35,969
Totally.

240
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:37,070
Yeah.

241
00:15:37,739 --> 00:15:40,407
So, I guess that means you and I get to be grocery buddies.

242
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,077
Hey, what's up with your voicemail greeting,

243
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:45,446
by the way?

244
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,648
One more.

245
00:15:46,781 --> 00:15:48,616
Okay, ready?

246
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:52,887
Hello.

247
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,590
This is Dennis's phone.

248
00:15:57,592 --> 00:15:59,828
Please leave a message...

249
00:16:00,895 --> 00:16:02,162
after the tone.

250
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:04,331
Fluffy bunny!

251
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,510
What are you thinking about?

252
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:21,315
Do you believe in the death penalty?

253
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:23,150
That's what you were thinking about?

254
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:28,857
I guess no. Because there's a chance

255
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:33,093
of executing someone innocent, and death is irrevocable.

256
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:37,464
Yeah, but there's some things you can't take back.

257
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,669
True.

258
00:16:46,741 --> 00:16:48,843
What's the worst thing you've ever done?

259
00:16:52,981 --> 00:16:55,148
What's the worst thing you've ever done?

260
00:16:55,984 --> 00:16:57,284
There's a few.

261
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,388
Mm.

262
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,462
This one time...

263
00:17:10,097 --> 00:17:12,065
Rocky and I, uh...

264
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:15,235
we were 16.

265
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,073
And, um...

266
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:23,410
It was my fault he died.

267
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,650
- What? <i>- It was my fault.</i>

268
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:34,488
Dean was supposed to pick me up from the airport.

269
00:17:35,489 --> 00:17:36,691
But he forgot.

270
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:41,194
And I could've just called a cab,

271
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:43,397
but I wanted him to pick me up,

272
00:17:43,531 --> 00:17:46,834
so I called him again and again and again,

273
00:17:46,968 --> 00:17:48,736
and I was relentless.

274
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:51,039
So, he broke the speed limit.

275
00:17:52,006 --> 00:17:53,541
And you can guess where this is going.

276
00:17:53,675 --> 00:17:55,777
He crashed.

277
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,714
My last words to him were...

278
00:18:01,348 --> 00:18:02,784
"Fuck you."

279
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:05,954
So... that's my story.

280
00:18:06,654 --> 00:18:07,689
Um...

281
00:18:09,991 --> 00:18:13,528
In fifth grade, I had a stye in my left eye.

282
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:17,431
On school picture day. It was...

283
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:20,100
swollen and red.

284
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:22,937
And I looked like Forest Whitaker.

285
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,740
So, I begged to stay home.

286
00:18:27,709 --> 00:18:29,077
But I was overruled,

287
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:33,280
so Dean pretended to be me for the yearbook.

288
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:37,752
He saved me. Um...

289
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:41,556
He was always there on the bad days.

290
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,559
When Ashley from down the street, uh,

291
00:18:44,692 --> 00:18:47,762
made fun of my pink pencil box, he called her a butter troll.

292
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:53,968
Uh, when my stepfather asked me not to come home anymore,

293
00:18:54,969 --> 00:18:56,470
Dean held my hand.

294
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:00,775
Feels like, uh...

295
00:19:02,076 --> 00:19:03,845
every day's a bad day now.

296
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,416
Um, sorry, uh...

297
00:19:10,718 --> 00:19:14,856
It hurts. Like, um, it's literally painful.

298
00:19:15,957 --> 00:19:18,191
But I like it because

299
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,928
if I don't have the pain, then...

300
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:23,698
he's really gone.

301
00:19:24,966 --> 00:19:27,035
And I'm actually alone.

302
00:20:49,717 --> 00:20:50,852
Excuse me.

303
00:20:51,652 --> 00:20:54,254
Hi. Um, is anybody sitting here?

304
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:58,291
No. Um, yeah, feel free.

305
00:20:58,425 --> 00:20:59,894
Uh, I'm almost done, but, uh, yeah,

306
00:21:00,027 --> 00:21:02,196
I-I don't have anywhere to be, so...

307
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:05,199
Oh. Oh, no, sorry. I just want the chair.

308
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:07,235
Yeah.

309
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:10,470
- Take it. - Okay, thanks.

310
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:19,647
That was tragic.

311
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,583
- Oh, you saw that? - I did, yeah. We all did.

312
00:21:22,717 --> 00:21:24,451
Everyone in the diner.

313
00:21:24,585 --> 00:21:26,319
You have to leave. You can't be here anymore.

314
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:27,789
- We voted. - Oh.

315
00:21:27,922 --> 00:21:29,757
I know. Come on. I'll escort you out.

316
00:21:29,891 --> 00:21:31,259
Come on. You have to come with me.

317
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:34,327
No, leave the sandwich. Yeah. Yeah. Here we go.

318
00:21:37,899 --> 00:21:39,466
Oh, my God, were you just looking at my butt?

319
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,434
No.

320
00:21:43,271 --> 00:21:44,972
They make really good sandwiches.

321
00:21:45,106 --> 00:21:47,008
Oh, I don't like really good sandwiches.

322
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:48,408
I like good ones.

323
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:51,179
What's your favorite sandwich?

324
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:52,780
- BLT. - Mm.

325
00:21:52,914 --> 00:21:55,415
- We can skip the small talk. - Yeah, yeah, we can.

326
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:57,118
Hmm. Ooh.

327
00:21:57,251 --> 00:21:59,486
What's your relationship like with your father?

328
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,955
Are you close with your parents?

329
00:22:01,088 --> 00:22:02,990
No, you can't answer a question with a question.

330
00:22:03,758 --> 00:22:05,026
- I'm close with my father. - Mm.

331
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:06,426
We don't talk much.

332
00:22:06,561 --> 00:22:08,763
It's an unspoken closeness. He lives in Japan.

333
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,031
- Japan? - Yeah.

334
00:22:10,164 --> 00:22:11,599
- Why Japan? - Uh, I was born in Japan.

335
00:22:11,732 --> 00:22:13,201
He's a professor in Osaka.

336
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,802
- Wait, really? Are you fluent? - Mm-hmm.

337
00:22:14,936 --> 00:22:16,469
Well, I mean, I-I understand fluently,

338
00:22:16,604 --> 00:22:18,539
but my accent's sort of-- Anyway.

339
00:22:18,673 --> 00:22:21,008
Uh, so don't ask me to say anything.

340
00:22:27,982 --> 00:22:29,449
What did I just say?

341
00:22:29,584 --> 00:22:31,819
- Something about milkshakes. - Oh, my God.

342
00:22:31,953 --> 00:22:33,554
- You're a skinny fucking liar. - Why do you speak Japanese?

343
00:22:33,688 --> 00:22:35,488
Because I lived in Tokyo. Why would you lie to me?

344
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:39,026
Is this over?

345
00:22:40,628 --> 00:22:41,863
No, you're cute.

346
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:44,665
I'm kind of obsessed with you.

347
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,068
- Wait, where did you park? - No, we passed it.

348
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:49,537
- Why didn't you say anything? - I was following you.

349
00:22:51,272 --> 00:22:53,507
Aw. You like following me?

350
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:03,483
Tell me something you've never told anyone.

351
00:23:04,518 --> 00:23:05,853
I've never seen <i>Steel Magnolias.</i>

352
00:23:05,987 --> 00:23:08,155
- Oh, that's so hot. - Yeah? Your turn.

353
00:23:08,289 --> 00:23:10,423
Uh, in eighth-grade science, I put the father hamster

354
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:11,859
back in the cage with the mother hamster,

355
00:23:11,993 --> 00:23:13,594
and he ate two of the babies.

356
00:23:13,728 --> 00:23:15,863
Oh, that's kind of kinky.

357
00:23:18,032 --> 00:23:19,767
If we were in a relationship, we could share clothes.

358
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:21,869
I don't think we're the same size.

359
00:23:22,003 --> 00:23:23,838
- How tall are you? - Five-ten.

360
00:23:23,971 --> 00:23:26,374
Mmm. I'm five-ten. Twins.

361
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:30,044
These even real?

362
00:23:30,177 --> 00:23:31,913
- You know, I am a twin. - What?

363
00:23:32,046 --> 00:23:34,181
- I'm a twin. - You have a twin?

364
00:23:34,315 --> 00:23:35,950
Yeah. Pinch my nipple.

365
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,752
- You messing with me right now? - No.

366
00:23:37,885 --> 00:23:40,087
Are you monozygotic?

367
00:23:40,221 --> 00:23:41,956
- If that means identical, yeah. - Oh!

368
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:44,325
I am obsessed with twins. I owned the entire

369
00:23:44,491 --> 00:23:46,426
<i>New Adventures of Mary-Kate and Ashley</i> book series.

370
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,529
I watched all their movies

371
00:23:48,663 --> 00:23:50,631
and all of their abruptly canceled TV series.

372
00:23:50,765 --> 00:23:53,567
I asked my mom for a twin every Christmas from age five...

373
00:23:53,701 --> 00:23:55,369
...until I learned what sex was.

374
00:23:55,503 --> 00:23:57,204
I can't believe you have a twin.

375
00:23:57,338 --> 00:23:58,639
- I love twins. - Yeah?

376
00:23:58,773 --> 00:24:00,374
- Yeah. - His name's Roman.

377
00:24:00,508 --> 00:24:04,078
Oh, Rocky and Roman. I fucking love that.

378
00:24:06,547 --> 00:24:09,650
Does he live in Portland? Does he live in this building?

379
00:24:11,852 --> 00:24:13,486
Did you just get harder?

380
00:24:17,858 --> 00:24:19,961
So, did you ever switch places?

381
00:24:20,094 --> 00:24:21,595
Sophomore year.

382
00:24:21,729 --> 00:24:23,965
Geometry final.

383
00:24:24,098 --> 00:24:25,933
What's the longest sentence

384
00:24:26,067 --> 00:24:27,902
you've ever said in unison?

385
00:24:28,035 --> 00:24:29,469
"All that she wants is another bagel."

386
00:24:29,603 --> 00:24:31,572
Oh, my God, I'm gonna come.

387
00:24:37,378 --> 00:24:39,313
So, why are you so obsessed with twins?

388
00:24:39,447 --> 00:24:41,449
Mm. I don't want to tell you.

389
00:24:41,582 --> 00:24:43,017
Oh, you're gonna tell me anyway. Come on.

390
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,484
It's embarrassing.

391
00:24:44,618 --> 00:24:47,421
Well, you've crossed that threshold tonight...

392
00:24:47,555 --> 00:24:49,590
...multiple times.

393
00:24:49,724 --> 00:24:52,126
Uh, um...

394
00:24:53,728 --> 00:24:57,198
I constructed this fantasy that my mother took me

395
00:24:57,331 --> 00:24:59,100
and my father took my twin,

396
00:24:59,233 --> 00:25:00,835
and they never wanted us to meet,

397
00:25:00,968 --> 00:25:02,336
and that's why

398
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,605
I was never allowed to visit him in Japan.

399
00:25:05,973 --> 00:25:07,675
Did you really believe that?

400
00:25:08,409 --> 00:25:10,511
Mm, maybe.

401
00:25:10,644 --> 00:25:12,947
I don't know. I wanted to.

402
00:25:14,148 --> 00:25:16,350
They say we're born alone,

403
00:25:16,484 --> 00:25:18,786
we live alone and we die alone,

404
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:22,056
but... for twins, that isn't true.

405
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,892
You have a built-in best friend.

406
00:25:28,295 --> 00:25:30,364
No, twins can get lonely too.

407
00:25:31,332 --> 00:25:33,000
I'm incredibly lonely.

408
00:25:33,134 --> 00:25:35,536
Mm-mm. You're just saying that to make me feel better

409
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:37,671
- about myself. - I'm not. I mean it.

410
00:25:37,805 --> 00:25:38,873
I mean it.

411
00:25:40,975 --> 00:25:43,310
I'm very adept at...

412
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:46,515
sharing myself with other people.

413
00:25:48,282 --> 00:25:50,017
But sometimes I can run empty.

414
00:25:52,186 --> 00:25:53,387
Because...

415
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:59,727
I'm always giving and not so much receiving.

416
00:26:00,694 --> 00:26:02,430
With Roman, it's fifty-fifty.

417
00:26:03,064 --> 00:26:04,665
Well, it was. I mean, we...

418
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,868
we don't really talk that much anymore.

419
00:26:08,402 --> 00:26:09,737
What happened?

420
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,038
Just life.

421
00:26:13,307 --> 00:26:16,243
Growing up, we were attached by the hip, obviously, but...

422
00:26:21,348 --> 00:26:24,218
We're very different... now.

423
00:26:25,086 --> 00:26:26,387
And I think that's...

424
00:26:27,855 --> 00:26:29,590
I think it's harder for him.

425
00:26:31,258 --> 00:26:34,462
There's a photo of us as kids where we're wearing

426
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:38,567
these matching pajamas, and to this day,

427
00:26:38,699 --> 00:26:42,236
I could not tell you which one I am in the picture.

428
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:43,538
It's crazy.

429
00:26:44,872 --> 00:26:46,073
I was "We."

430
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,609
And now, I'm "I."

431
00:26:50,244 --> 00:26:51,546
You miss him.

432
00:26:52,046 --> 00:26:53,582
Very much.

433
00:27:00,354 --> 00:27:01,889
He's my favorite person.

434
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:06,494
He thinks I'm the good twin, but it's him.

435
00:27:08,597 --> 00:27:10,464
When we were really little, I...

436
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:13,334
I broke my big toe tripping up the stairs one time,

437
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:16,303
and later that same day,

438
00:27:16,437 --> 00:27:20,674
Roman comes home and has a broken foot.

439
00:27:22,209 --> 00:27:25,079
He didn't want me to be in pain by myself.

440
00:27:25,212 --> 00:27:27,648
Oh. Oh, my God, that's adorable.

441
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:29,416
He probably, like, dropped a bowling ball

442
00:27:29,551 --> 00:27:30,484
on it or something.

443
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:31,952
- My God. - I know.

444
00:27:37,124 --> 00:27:38,759
I've never broken a bone.

445
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:42,363
Oh, no. Now, it's gonna happen.

446
00:27:42,496 --> 00:27:44,365
It's like a thing. You can't say that.

447
00:27:44,498 --> 00:27:45,466
Okay.

448
00:27:49,504 --> 00:27:50,838
You should call him.

449
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,543
Yeah, I should.

450
00:27:54,675 --> 00:27:56,110
You should call him and I'll listen.

451
00:27:56,243 --> 00:27:57,378
Oh, Jesus.

452
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:00,848
Hold your hippos.

453
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:03,684
No, I can't.

454
00:28:03,817 --> 00:28:06,020
I must amend your broken twinship.

455
00:28:06,153 --> 00:28:08,189
My whole life has been waiting for this moment.

456
00:28:11,192 --> 00:28:12,693
You're really sweet.

457
00:28:17,632 --> 00:28:19,333
I think you'd be a good twin.

458
00:28:38,953 --> 00:28:40,988
I'm falling in love with you.

459
00:28:44,158 --> 00:28:45,359
I heard that.

460
00:29:05,846 --> 00:29:08,949
I like this font for the OM.

461
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:11,218
Ugh, lobster? You're killing me.

462
00:29:11,752 --> 00:29:13,821
That's offensive to sweatshop workers,

463
00:29:13,954 --> 00:29:15,122
don't you think?

464
00:29:16,257 --> 00:29:18,359
Hey, can I ask you a personal question?

465
00:29:18,892 --> 00:29:21,962
I don't really like to talk about my personal life at work.

466
00:29:22,096 --> 00:29:24,131
Well, it's about my personal life.

467
00:29:25,065 --> 00:29:26,800
Sure, that's fine.

468
00:29:26,934 --> 00:29:28,435
So I had this amazing date with a guy,

469
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,404
and we both like really good sandwiches,

470
00:29:30,538 --> 00:29:32,806
so I texted him on Monday, "Sandwiches for dinner?"

471
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,075
"How's tomorrow or Wednesday or Thursday or Friday?"

472
00:29:35,209 --> 00:29:36,645
And he didn't respond.

473
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:38,747
That's too bad.

474
00:29:38,879 --> 00:29:40,781
- Onto the next. - Well, I'm not done.

475
00:29:40,914 --> 00:29:42,449
So I followed up with him on Tuesday,

476
00:29:42,584 --> 00:29:44,653
"Actually, can't do Thursday," even though I could.

477
00:29:44,785 --> 00:29:47,454
"How's tomorrow, aka Wednesday or Friday?"

478
00:29:47,589 --> 00:29:48,822
PS, how was your day?"

479
00:29:48,956 --> 00:29:50,592
And nothing.

480
00:29:50,725 --> 00:29:52,560
How long do you think I should wait before I text him again?

481
00:29:52,694 --> 00:29:54,596
Never text him again.

482
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:57,097
He doesn't like you.

483
00:29:58,465 --> 00:29:59,433
Mm.

484
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:01,068
Hi, Dennis.

485
00:30:01,201 --> 00:30:02,903
- Hey, Marcie. - How's your day going?

486
00:30:03,037 --> 00:30:04,471
Ugh, well. Can I ask you

487
00:30:04,606 --> 00:30:05,774
- a personal question? - Mm-hmm.

488
00:30:05,906 --> 00:30:07,509
How many consecutive texts can you send

489
00:30:07,642 --> 00:30:09,276
to a potential soulmate before you stop respecting yourself?

490
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:11,780
- I'm at five. - And he hasn't responded?

491
00:30:11,912 --> 00:30:13,748
No. And we had the best date ever.

492
00:30:13,881 --> 00:30:15,282
Eight hours awake and four hours asleep.

493
00:30:15,416 --> 00:30:16,850
I don't understand. Is he blowing me off?

494
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:19,353
No, that's silly. Why would anyone ignore you?

495
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:20,689
You're such a great guy.

496
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:23,157
Maybe he's just really busy.

497
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,992
Sometimes when the phones are really busy,

498
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:27,796
I forget to reply to things until days later.

499
00:30:27,928 --> 00:30:29,531
I think some people forget how much you mean to them

500
00:30:29,664 --> 00:30:30,998
until they see your face, you know?

501
00:30:31,131 --> 00:30:32,667
Like out of sight, out of mind.

502
00:30:32,801 --> 00:30:34,703
I kind of just wanna show up at his door,

503
00:30:34,835 --> 00:30:36,170
like that Carole King song.

504
00:30:36,303 --> 00:30:37,438
That's romantic, right?

505
00:30:37,971 --> 00:30:40,542
Maybe. It could be. Yeah.

506
00:30:41,141 --> 00:30:42,610
I mean, you know him better than I do,

507
00:30:42,744 --> 00:30:43,944
so I say go with your gut.

508
00:30:44,078 --> 00:30:45,379
You're so right.

509
00:30:45,513 --> 00:30:47,281
I knew you were the person to ask.

510
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,218
Reception.

511
00:30:54,922 --> 00:30:56,023
<i>Hello?</i>

512
00:30:56,691 --> 00:30:57,991
UPS.

513
00:30:58,158 --> 00:30:59,860
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

514
00:31:13,941 --> 00:31:15,376
- Come on. - Okay.

515
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:18,245
I can't keep up with this drama.

516
00:31:28,723 --> 00:31:29,824
- Is it really? - Yeah.

517
00:31:29,957 --> 00:31:31,191
Are you serious?

518
00:31:32,126 --> 00:31:33,327
Jesus Christ.

519
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,890
I'm traversing here!

520
00:32:02,022 --> 00:32:03,591
- I've always wanted to say that. - Wait,

521
00:32:03,725 --> 00:32:05,794
that was so sexy.

522
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,100
Rocky!

523
00:32:14,234 --> 00:32:16,036
Fuck you!

524
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,772
Do you know that guy?

525
00:32:17,906 --> 00:32:19,641
Yeah. Give me two minutes.

526
00:32:22,744 --> 00:32:23,778
Hi.

527
00:32:27,114 --> 00:32:28,917
I was gonna call you.

528
00:33:30,477 --> 00:33:33,280
Hi. You've reached the voicemail of Dennis Benver.

529
00:33:33,413 --> 00:33:36,016
I'm sorry I can't get to the phone right now.

530
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:39,453
I'll try calling you back at a future time and date.

531
00:33:39,587 --> 00:33:42,557
Hi. You've reached the voicemail of Dennis.

532
00:33:43,156 --> 00:33:44,526
I'm so sorry I missed your call,

533
00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:46,059
but if you leave your name and your number,

534
00:33:46,193 --> 00:33:49,296
I'll get back to you in a reasonable time.

535
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,966
Thanks for calling. Leave a message.

536
00:33:52,099 --> 00:33:56,004
I'm sorry. The call you entered cannot be completed as dialed.

537
00:33:56,136 --> 00:33:58,071
- Please hang up and try again. - Hi.

538
00:33:58,205 --> 00:34:01,576
If you need help, hang up and then call your operator.

539
00:34:04,979 --> 00:34:07,515
Hey, uh...

540
00:34:08,181 --> 00:34:10,050
Nobody's ever gonna hear this. Um...

541
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:14,354
<i>I answered a call from an unknown number once,</i>

542
00:34:14,522 --> 00:34:17,525
<i>and he said, "Hey, I was thinking about you.</i>

543
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:19,059
<i>What are you doing tonight?"</i>

544
00:34:19,827 --> 00:34:23,397
<i>And we baked a strawberry shortcake.</i>

545
00:34:25,934 --> 00:34:27,234
<i>And in the morning,</i>

546
00:34:27,401 --> 00:34:28,870
<i>I went looking for another slice.</i>

547
00:34:30,705 --> 00:34:32,740
<i>I forgot it was just a dream.</i>

548
00:35:13,748 --> 00:35:15,049
We don't bite.

549
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,987
Oh, sorry. I think I'm lost.

550
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,387
I understand.

551
00:35:21,089 --> 00:35:23,091
You can just listen if you want.

552
00:35:25,793 --> 00:35:27,427
What's your twin's name?

553
00:35:34,102 --> 00:35:36,604
Rocky was scared of the dark when we were kids.

554
00:35:38,539 --> 00:35:39,941
We had bunk beds,

555
00:35:40,742 --> 00:35:44,579
but me and him would always share the top bunk.

556
00:35:46,146 --> 00:35:48,181
So, the monsters couldn't get him.

557
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,656
Then one night, he said that he wasn't afraid.

558
00:35:56,057 --> 00:35:58,325
And that I was the one who was afraid.

559
00:35:59,459 --> 00:36:00,828
Fucking pissed me off.

560
00:36:02,462 --> 00:36:03,430
Uh...

561
00:36:04,065 --> 00:36:06,534
We were probably too old to be sharing a bed

562
00:36:06,668 --> 00:36:08,368
at that point, anyway.

563
00:36:11,572 --> 00:36:14,776
I don't-- I don't know why I was telling that story.

564
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,387
- Hi, Dennis! - Oh, fuck me!

565
00:37:00,521 --> 00:37:03,057
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.

566
00:37:03,191 --> 00:37:04,424
I thought I was the last one here.

567
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:05,993
Are you still working?

568
00:37:06,127 --> 00:37:07,862
No, I'm studying.

569
00:37:08,563 --> 00:37:09,731
For the LSAT.

570
00:37:10,531 --> 00:37:12,533
I didn't know you wanted to be a lawyer.

571
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:14,602
That's so cool! Wow!

572
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:19,841
Okay, well, have a good night.

573
00:37:19,974 --> 00:37:23,711
Okay! Bye, Dennis. Oh, and good luck.

574
00:37:40,061 --> 00:37:41,662
- Hello? <i>- Hey.</i>

575
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:43,531
<i>It's Roman.</i>

576
00:37:43,664 --> 00:37:44,565
Hey.

577
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:46,801
<i>You wanna get groceries with me?</i>

578
00:37:47,535 --> 00:37:51,038
Yeah! I've been, um, meaning to go to the store.

579
00:38:44,491 --> 00:38:45,693
Rocky!

580
00:38:47,228 --> 00:38:49,864
Oh. Wow. You...

581
00:38:49,997 --> 00:38:52,633
Sorry, you must be Rocky's brother?

582
00:38:52,767 --> 00:38:54,802
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

583
00:38:54,936 --> 00:38:57,171
Um, I'm so sorry for your loss.

584
00:38:57,305 --> 00:38:59,974
Thanks. Were you at the service or...

585
00:39:00,107 --> 00:39:02,777
No, I was-- I was in Tahiti, for work.

586
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:06,514
Uh, but I was-- I was there when he died.

587
00:39:06,647 --> 00:39:08,316
Oh, you're that guy.

588
00:39:08,448 --> 00:39:10,017
We were just trying to get some froyo,

589
00:39:10,151 --> 00:39:13,888
and this crazy fucking lunatic, like, starts screaming at us.

590
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:15,590
And so, Rocky stepped into the street,

591
00:39:15,723 --> 00:39:17,692
and this car came out of, like, nowhere,

592
00:39:17,825 --> 00:39:19,392
and I heard this crunching sound.

593
00:39:19,527 --> 00:39:22,129
Wow. Um, you don't need to hear all that.

594
00:39:22,263 --> 00:39:25,299
I'm sorry. I'm in the process of switching therapists.

595
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:29,136
Did you get a look at the crazy screaming guy or...

596
00:39:30,437 --> 00:39:33,473
I couldn't tell you, honestly. It just-- It happened so fast.

597
00:39:33,608 --> 00:39:35,343
Uh, I didn't get a good look at him.

598
00:39:35,475 --> 00:39:38,312
Oh. I've just, uh, thought a lot about

599
00:39:38,445 --> 00:39:41,048
what I would do to that guy if I ever saw him.

600
00:39:42,516 --> 00:39:44,886
Rip his fucking testicles right out of his throat,

601
00:39:45,019 --> 00:39:47,221
shove them back down through his own dick hole,

602
00:39:47,355 --> 00:39:48,623
back out his ass.

603
00:39:49,357 --> 00:39:52,392
Pummel his fucking face till he was past his expiration date.

604
00:39:56,631 --> 00:39:58,099
Hi. I'm sorry. I didn't--

605
00:39:58,232 --> 00:40:00,668
I didn't mean to interrupt your conversation,

606
00:40:00,801 --> 00:40:02,570
but, um... Oh!

607
00:40:03,571 --> 00:40:04,839
Do I know you?

608
00:40:06,173 --> 00:40:08,009
No, sorry. I'm-I'm Rupert.

609
00:40:08,142 --> 00:40:10,177
- I'm just visiting from London. - Oh.

610
00:40:10,311 --> 00:40:11,846
But it happens to me all the time, actually.

611
00:40:11,979 --> 00:40:14,081
One of those faces. All the time. I always say that.

612
00:40:14,215 --> 00:40:16,017
Okay. Well, that must be,

613
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,218
that must be very nice.

614
00:40:17,351 --> 00:40:18,686
Anyway, I just wanted to say "Hi,"

615
00:40:18,819 --> 00:40:21,188
and, um, sorry this was awkward,

616
00:40:21,322 --> 00:40:23,024
but, yeah, my condolences.

617
00:40:23,157 --> 00:40:24,959
- Bye, Rupert. - Thanks.

618
00:40:25,893 --> 00:40:26,961
Have a good one.

619
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:30,965
What the hell was that?

620
00:40:31,565 --> 00:40:33,466
I start talking in different accents

621
00:40:33,601 --> 00:40:35,435
when I find someone attractive.

622
00:40:36,003 --> 00:40:37,305
It's a defense mechanism.

623
00:40:38,205 --> 00:40:39,439
Wait, shit.

624
00:40:39,573 --> 00:40:40,741
- Let me go get him back. - No!

625
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:44,578
So was he your type?

626
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:45,947
Uh...

627
00:40:47,248 --> 00:40:49,250
I don't think I have a type.

628
00:40:51,852 --> 00:40:53,554
You know, there's a gay guy at work.

629
00:40:53,688 --> 00:40:54,755
Sam.

630
00:40:55,556 --> 00:40:57,992
You should meet him. I think you'd really get along.

631
00:40:58,693 --> 00:41:00,394
You know, that's sort of like, "You're both Asian.

632
00:41:00,528 --> 00:41:02,330
I'm sure you have lots of Asian things to talk about."

633
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:04,231
No, man, I'm trying to hook you up.

634
00:41:04,799 --> 00:41:05,900
Come on.

635
00:41:07,902 --> 00:41:09,437
What kind of girls are you into?

636
00:41:11,872 --> 00:41:13,941
I like boobs.

637
00:41:14,775 --> 00:41:17,611
But honestly, at this point, I just wanna meet a nice girl.

638
00:41:18,245 --> 00:41:19,680
Nice girls don't have boobs?

639
00:41:21,248 --> 00:41:22,783
If you find one, let me know.

640
00:41:23,284 --> 00:41:24,585
Together or separate?

641
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:26,187
- Together. - Separate.

642
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,961
Why is this fucking light on?

643
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,370
my personal life!

644
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,016
- Hi, Dennis. - Mm, hi, Marcie.

645
00:41:55,149 --> 00:41:57,718
- You look really happy. - Mm, thanks.

646
00:41:58,419 --> 00:42:01,856
- I am happy. - That's amazing! Good for you.

647
00:42:01,989 --> 00:42:05,326
Yeah. I'm going to Seattle this weekend for a hockey game.

648
00:42:05,459 --> 00:42:08,796
Ah, how exciting. I love winter sports.

649
00:42:08,929 --> 00:42:10,197
It's the Michigan in me.

650
00:42:10,798 --> 00:42:12,400
Yeah, it's a bit testosterone-y for my taste,

651
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:13,667
but Roman's into it,

652
00:42:13,801 --> 00:42:15,669
and relationships are about compromise.

653
00:42:15,803 --> 00:42:17,738
Ooh! Who's Roman?

654
00:42:17,872 --> 00:42:19,240
Is he your boyfriend?

655
00:42:19,373 --> 00:42:22,810
No. Um, we're just pals.

656
00:42:23,711 --> 00:42:25,546
- That's really nice. - Yeah.

657
00:42:26,981 --> 00:42:30,184
- Are you married? - Me?

658
00:42:30,317 --> 00:42:32,920
No. Um, did you think I was married?

659
00:42:34,388 --> 00:42:35,723
Yeah, you just seem like someone

660
00:42:35,856 --> 00:42:37,058
who would be married by your age.

661
00:42:37,658 --> 00:42:39,326
It's funny you say that, because all the women

662
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,895
in my family married very young,

663
00:42:41,028 --> 00:42:42,196
and I always thought

664
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:44,498
I would have a kid before I turned 28.

665
00:42:44,632 --> 00:42:46,567
And sure, these days, there are advancements,

666
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:49,336
but the clock is still ticking.

667
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:50,539
For my eggs.

668
00:42:53,674 --> 00:42:55,109
Right, well, I'm gonna get more cake.

669
00:42:55,242 --> 00:42:56,911
Okay. I'll just stand here.

670
00:44:05,614 --> 00:44:07,414
So she asked if I want an ice cream cone,

671
00:44:07,549 --> 00:44:09,917
and I said, "Yes, but I would like ice cream in it."

672
00:44:11,285 --> 00:44:12,453
- Ah. - What?

673
00:44:12,587 --> 00:44:14,255
Nothing. My dog jaw's bothering me.

674
00:44:14,388 --> 00:44:15,489
- Your dog jaw? - Yeah.

675
00:44:15,624 --> 00:44:17,324
- You never heard of dog jaw? - No.

676
00:44:17,458 --> 00:44:18,993
It's like I was born with a jawbone

677
00:44:19,126 --> 00:44:20,661
that's shaped like a paw print.

678
00:44:20,794 --> 00:44:21,929
- What? - Here. Yeah, you can feel it right here.

679
00:44:22,062 --> 00:44:23,464
- Here? - Yeah.

680
00:44:23,598 --> 00:44:24,965
Faggots.

681
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:26,535
Wait, what'd you say?

682
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:29,436
- It's fine. Let it go. - Hey! Fuck did you say?

683
00:44:32,106 --> 00:44:33,674
I said, "Look at those faggots."

684
00:44:34,643 --> 00:44:35,776
Why don't you apologize?

685
00:44:36,844 --> 00:44:38,479
Hey, why don't you suck my dick?

686
00:44:40,014 --> 00:44:41,448
Okay, I will suck whosever dick

687
00:44:41,583 --> 00:44:43,884
if we can just de-escalate the situation.

688
00:44:44,018 --> 00:44:45,452
You should listen to your girlfriend.

689
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,121
Say you're sorry.

690
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,994
I'm sorry.

691
00:44:59,601 --> 00:45:02,303
Fuck you!

692
00:45:02,436 --> 00:45:05,372
Oh. There's one here. Oh!

693
00:45:07,542 --> 00:45:08,876
Oh, no. I don't like this.

694
00:45:09,009 --> 00:45:11,212
Oh, oh, what? Ow!

695
00:45:11,345 --> 00:45:12,681
Come here, you little fucking piece

696
00:45:12,813 --> 00:45:16,083
of shit!

697
00:45:16,217 --> 00:45:17,718
Roman.

698
00:45:17,851 --> 00:45:19,353
Roman. Roman.

699
00:45:19,486 --> 00:45:21,388
Roman, Roman, Roman! Stop, stop, stop!

700
00:45:23,824 --> 00:45:24,892
Oh, fuck!

701
00:45:25,025 --> 00:45:26,760
- Let's go. Let's go. - Oh, fuck.

702
00:45:26,894 --> 00:45:28,563
Fuck!

703
00:45:31,031 --> 00:45:33,400
I thought Gen Z was supposed to be nice.

704
00:45:37,505 --> 00:45:39,406
I got ice in a bucket.

705
00:45:39,541 --> 00:45:40,841
Need me to put it anywhere on you?

706
00:45:40,975 --> 00:45:43,344
Yeah, my bourbon. I poured you one too.

707
00:45:49,984 --> 00:45:51,720
All right.

708
00:45:51,852 --> 00:45:53,287
- Cheers. - Cheers.

709
00:45:58,826 --> 00:46:01,762
Okay.

710
00:46:05,366 --> 00:46:07,702
So, where'd you learn to beat people up?

711
00:46:09,937 --> 00:46:12,106
I took a little karate as a kid,

712
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:14,576
but I quit when I didn't make blue belt.

713
00:46:15,442 --> 00:46:18,245
Then I guess I dabbled in some MMA after high school,

714
00:46:18,379 --> 00:46:20,749
but honestly, you don't learn to fight in a classroom.

715
00:46:20,881 --> 00:46:22,483
You learn in the streets.

716
00:46:22,617 --> 00:46:24,285
In the streets?

717
00:46:24,418 --> 00:46:26,487
Who are you?

718
00:46:27,955 --> 00:46:29,123
So, you're not mad?

719
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:32,092
Thought maybe you wouldn't...

720
00:46:33,427 --> 00:46:35,162
condone violence or something.

721
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:37,064
It was self-defense.

722
00:46:38,132 --> 00:46:40,134
For the first half.

723
00:46:42,369 --> 00:46:44,972
Well, if you're going to hell, keep going.

724
00:46:45,105 --> 00:46:46,073
Right?

725
00:46:47,408 --> 00:46:50,177
Right.

726
00:46:53,147 --> 00:46:54,982
Hey, can I confess something to you?

727
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,790
I've been using Rocky's gym membership.

728
00:47:02,956 --> 00:47:04,358
Pretending I'm him.

729
00:47:08,596 --> 00:47:10,331
It's kind of fucked up, right?

730
00:47:11,098 --> 00:47:12,767
Yeah, that's...

731
00:47:13,568 --> 00:47:14,536
crazy.

732
00:47:16,337 --> 00:47:18,673
You know, I actually got hit on there the other day.

733
00:47:19,641 --> 00:47:22,042
I thought maybe the guy knew Rocky, so, uh,

734
00:47:22,577 --> 00:47:23,611
I just went with it.

735
00:47:24,411 --> 00:47:25,647
What did he say?

736
00:47:26,413 --> 00:47:28,482
He was like, "Someone's been working their arms."

737
00:47:28,616 --> 00:47:31,786
- He did not say that. - Yeah, he did. Yeah, he...

738
00:47:31,919 --> 00:47:34,154
Then I said, uh, "Yeah,

739
00:47:34,288 --> 00:47:36,156
you know, I've been working 'em real good."

740
00:47:39,493 --> 00:47:41,663
You're such a tease.

741
00:47:41,796 --> 00:47:43,063
What? I experimented.

742
00:47:43,197 --> 00:47:45,032
- You did? - Mm.

743
00:47:48,168 --> 00:47:49,838
I, uh...

744
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:51,806
...kissed a guy at a party once.

745
00:47:55,175 --> 00:47:57,244
It was after Rocky came out.

746
00:47:57,378 --> 00:47:59,380
I think I was just trying to understand.

747
00:48:01,549 --> 00:48:02,717
I never told him that.

748
00:48:11,225 --> 00:48:14,194
You could talk to me like I'm Rocky.

749
00:48:22,236 --> 00:48:25,573
Yeah, so you're dead now.

750
00:48:25,707 --> 00:48:27,709
That's what you get for not looking both ways.

751
00:48:29,744 --> 00:48:31,078
You only wanna look forward.

752
00:48:33,313 --> 00:48:34,948
Sorry, I don't even know what to...

753
00:48:36,751 --> 00:48:38,018
I can't even remember the last time

754
00:48:38,152 --> 00:48:39,420
we had a real conversation.

755
00:48:41,088 --> 00:48:44,358
That wasn't, "How's work?" You know, "How's Mom?"

756
00:48:47,428 --> 00:48:49,296
And it's always on your time too.

757
00:48:50,497 --> 00:48:51,800
Better things to do, right?

758
00:48:54,903 --> 00:48:57,104
You wished me a "happy birthday" the day after.

759
00:48:58,506 --> 00:49:00,040
And, I mean, I know you didn't forget.

760
00:49:00,174 --> 00:49:02,943
Like, I'm-I'm pretty stupid, but I'm not that fucking stupid.

761
00:49:05,045 --> 00:49:08,550
You know, I actually waited until midnight, just in case,

762
00:49:08,683 --> 00:49:11,485
and... and the second it...

763
00:49:13,387 --> 00:49:14,823
Well, I snapped, 'cause...

764
00:49:16,624 --> 00:49:18,660
to be honest, you're so fucking selfish.

765
00:49:21,629 --> 00:49:24,097
Like, what, you don't-- you... you don't wanna deal with me?

766
00:49:24,899 --> 00:49:27,968
You know, I'm-- I'm sorry I don't read politics,

767
00:49:28,101 --> 00:49:30,905
or... ...like, or whatever, but, like...

768
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:36,911
You know what?

769
00:49:37,812 --> 00:49:39,914
It's your fucking fault we're like this.

770
00:49:41,616 --> 00:49:43,651
Yeah, you couldn't wait to get away. I mean, I would've,

771
00:49:44,151 --> 00:49:45,620
I would've followed you to college.

772
00:49:45,753 --> 00:49:47,287
I would've gone to Japan. I would've figured it out.

773
00:49:48,656 --> 00:49:50,324
But you never even fucking asked me!

774
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:56,798
Sorry.

775
00:49:59,734 --> 00:50:01,101
I'm sorry!

776
00:50:01,235 --> 00:50:03,170
I'm sorry I can't control my anger.

777
00:50:06,139 --> 00:50:09,343
And I'm sorry I blew up at you when you told me you like guys.

778
00:50:12,947 --> 00:50:14,883
I'm sorry I called you a faggot.

779
00:50:17,585 --> 00:50:19,486
I wish I could take it back.

780
00:50:21,154 --> 00:50:22,891
Oh, and your face when I said it,

781
00:50:23,056 --> 00:50:25,025
I...

782
00:50:25,158 --> 00:50:26,661
I know that's why you left!

783
00:50:29,096 --> 00:50:32,901
I think I was just-- I was scared that...

784
00:50:33,033 --> 00:50:35,168
I don't... I don't know.

785
00:50:36,004 --> 00:50:38,673
If I didn't... if I didn't...

786
00:50:41,041 --> 00:50:43,043
If you weren't like me, and we weren't the same,

787
00:50:43,176 --> 00:50:45,379
then... then I wouldn't know who I was, you know?

788
00:50:45,513 --> 00:50:47,314
But that-- but that's okay, because you...

789
00:50:47,447 --> 00:50:49,551
you can talk about guys, and I can talk about girls,

790
00:50:49,684 --> 00:50:51,653
and we both still...

791
00:50:51,786 --> 00:50:56,156
you know, like video games, and-and hockey, and pizza.

792
00:50:56,290 --> 00:50:58,492
Well, everybody likes pizza.

793
00:51:02,697 --> 00:51:05,198
I don't know how to fucking be here without you.

794
00:51:09,871 --> 00:51:12,774
I don't know how to fucking be here without you!

795
00:51:14,709 --> 00:51:18,445
I don't know how to fucking be here without you!

796
00:51:35,897 --> 00:51:37,732
I wish you could've met Rocky.

797
00:51:41,569 --> 00:51:43,236
He would've really liked you.

798
00:51:55,583 --> 00:51:57,085
There might not be a lot of people there.

799
00:51:57,217 --> 00:52:00,153
Just so you know, uh, Marcie's kind of a...

800
00:52:00,287 --> 00:52:02,389
I mean, I don't wanna say she's a loser, but,

801
00:52:02,523 --> 00:52:03,725
I mean, you'll see.

802
00:52:11,866 --> 00:52:12,800
Roman?

803
00:52:13,935 --> 00:52:15,837
Whoa, Sammy. What are you doing here?

804
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:18,006
Oh, I took a woodworking class with Marcie.

805
00:52:18,138 --> 00:52:19,406
What are you doing here?

806
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:21,676
This is my buddy Dennis. He works with Marcie.

807
00:52:22,476 --> 00:52:24,679
Oh, hey, what's up? I'm-I'm Sammy.

808
00:52:24,812 --> 00:52:26,346
Hi.

809
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,582
He's the gay guy from work

810
00:52:27,715 --> 00:52:29,017
I was telling you about.

811
00:52:29,149 --> 00:52:30,685
What are the odds?

812
00:52:30,818 --> 00:52:32,319
Hi. I hear we have a lot in common.

813
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,088
Do you?

814
00:52:34,221 --> 00:52:35,590
I'll go get us a couple of drinks.

815
00:52:35,723 --> 00:52:37,692
Why don't, uh, you two mingle?

816
00:52:46,466 --> 00:52:48,770
- Oh, I fucking hate that song. - I love this song.

817
00:52:51,739 --> 00:52:54,776
Hmm. So, uh, you like wood?

818
00:52:55,442 --> 00:52:59,346
- Um... - Oh, uh... Yeah.

819
00:52:59,479 --> 00:53:01,783
I, uh, I like to use my hands.

820
00:53:01,916 --> 00:53:03,151
I have soft hands.

821
00:53:04,184 --> 00:53:05,653
- Cool. - I was told I have the hands

822
00:53:05,787 --> 00:53:07,320
of somebody who's never worked a day in their life.

823
00:53:07,454 --> 00:53:09,456
- Wow! - I think by my mother.

824
00:53:11,125 --> 00:53:12,060
Hi!

825
00:53:12,426 --> 00:53:14,028
Hi. Sorry, I'm-I'm...

826
00:53:14,162 --> 00:53:15,462
- Can I feel? - ...Roman.

827
00:53:15,596 --> 00:53:17,197
- Yeah. - I'm Marcie.

828
00:53:20,802 --> 00:53:21,903
Very soft.

829
00:53:22,937 --> 00:53:23,871
Yeah.

830
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:26,741
Um...

831
00:53:28,142 --> 00:53:29,677
any other hobbies?

832
00:53:29,811 --> 00:53:34,314
Hiking, skiing, paragliding, rock climbing, mountainboarding,

833
00:53:34,448 --> 00:53:36,918
white water rafting. Parkour.

834
00:53:37,652 --> 00:53:39,219
Feel like that's too many.

835
00:53:39,352 --> 00:53:40,688
It's a bit of a problem.

836
00:53:40,822 --> 00:53:43,191
I'm sort of an adrena-junkie, you know?

837
00:53:43,356 --> 00:53:45,159
Isn't parkour dangerous?

838
00:53:45,292 --> 00:53:47,360
- No. - But people die doing it?

839
00:53:47,962 --> 00:53:48,996
Yes.

840
00:53:50,531 --> 00:53:51,699
Okay.

841
00:53:51,833 --> 00:53:54,001
You just have to know your limits.

842
00:53:54,135 --> 00:53:56,938
I don't know my limits!

843
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:00,240
Like, what's the wildest thing you did this year?

844
00:54:02,043 --> 00:54:03,878
Nothing comes to mind. Um...

845
00:54:05,012 --> 00:54:06,681
jury duty. Or I almost--

846
00:54:06,814 --> 00:54:09,249
I had a conflict, so they didn't pick me.

847
00:54:12,687 --> 00:54:14,589
You're cute.

848
00:54:20,194 --> 00:54:21,963
Oh, you never played the original <i>Sims?</i>

849
00:54:22,096 --> 00:54:23,631
Oh, man, it's the best.

850
00:54:23,765 --> 00:54:25,600
Actually, a lot of people don't realize it was really hard.

851
00:54:25,733 --> 00:54:27,135
'Cause you don't get weekends,

852
00:54:27,267 --> 00:54:28,936
so you have to spend all your time going to work,

853
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:31,139
going to sleep, showering, cleaning, cooking,

854
00:54:31,271 --> 00:54:33,708
pooping, you know? Sorry.

855
00:54:33,841 --> 00:54:35,810
But, yeah, you really have to tend to their needs,

856
00:54:35,943 --> 00:54:37,945
'cause, um, they'll let you know about it.

857
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,446
They get very cranky.

858
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:42,415
Um, they'll pee their pants.

859
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:45,987
They'll, uh, get very depressed, actually.

860
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,287
They can get depressed.

861
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:49,257
Oh. Wow. I...

862
00:54:49,957 --> 00:54:51,759
I always just thought it was a silly game

863
00:54:51,893 --> 00:54:54,095
- where they talk gibberish. - No, no, no.

864
00:54:54,228 --> 00:54:57,397
There's stakes. Yeah. It's life or death out there.

865
00:54:57,532 --> 00:54:59,801
And it's actually not gibberish. It's Simlish.

866
00:55:00,535 --> 00:55:02,335
It's like it's whole own language.

867
00:55:09,544 --> 00:55:11,512
Sorry.

868
00:55:11,646 --> 00:55:13,247
Sorry. That's dumb.

869
00:55:14,282 --> 00:55:16,416
No, it's really sweet.

870
00:55:16,551 --> 00:55:18,686
It was just my favorite game when I was a kid.

871
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,155
I have a twin brother.

872
00:55:21,289 --> 00:55:24,158
We were obsessed with it, so we just would play it

873
00:55:24,292 --> 00:55:25,793
for hours together.

874
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:29,530
Real hours, not <i>Sims</i> hours. Yeah.

875
00:55:29,664 --> 00:55:31,498
Part of me always thought that's what my life would be like

876
00:55:31,632 --> 00:55:33,034
when we got older too.

877
00:55:33,167 --> 00:55:34,434
Rocky and I would get a house

878
00:55:34,569 --> 00:55:36,369
and shoot hoops on the SuperDoop,

879
00:55:36,504 --> 00:55:38,039
talk in the hot tub.

880
00:55:38,172 --> 00:55:39,774
I was always the stay-at-home twin.

881
00:55:39,907 --> 00:55:42,009
He'd get the job, the promotion,

882
00:55:42,143 --> 00:55:45,513
and I'd kind of clean the house, and, you know, fix things,

883
00:55:45,646 --> 00:55:47,982
and cook the meals, and...

884
00:55:49,449 --> 00:55:50,818
I'd always burn down the kitchen too.

885
00:55:50,952 --> 00:55:52,720
Uh, he hated that.

886
00:55:53,688 --> 00:55:55,289
Do you and Rocky still play?

887
00:55:55,422 --> 00:55:57,525
No, he, uh,

888
00:55:57,658 --> 00:56:00,127
he passed away a couple months ago, actually.

889
00:56:00,862 --> 00:56:02,296
Oh, no.

890
00:56:03,331 --> 00:56:05,299
- I'm so sorry. - Nah, it's okay.

891
00:56:05,867 --> 00:56:08,202
Um, I mean, you didn't know.

892
00:56:10,638 --> 00:56:13,307
I'm so sorry.

893
00:56:14,675 --> 00:56:17,511
- Oh... - Marcie! Happy--

894
00:56:17,645 --> 00:56:20,413
- Oh, my God. Are you okay? - I'm fine.

895
00:56:20,548 --> 00:56:23,383
I'm just an emotional drinker.

896
00:56:23,517 --> 00:56:25,653
Shelly, happy Halloween.

897
00:56:25,786 --> 00:56:27,355
- Happy Halloween! - You look so great.

898
00:56:27,487 --> 00:56:29,357
Thank you!

899
00:56:51,178 --> 00:56:52,713
- Hey, Marcie. - Hi, Dennis.

900
00:56:52,847 --> 00:56:54,882
- Great party. - Yeah. Thanks for coming.

901
00:56:55,016 --> 00:56:56,784
You have so many friends. Never would've guessed.

902
00:56:56,918 --> 00:56:58,519
Really? Huh.

903
00:56:58,653 --> 00:56:59,954
That's interesting, yeah.

904
00:57:00,087 --> 00:57:01,789
I mean, everyone at work sees you a certain way,

905
00:57:01,923 --> 00:57:04,491
but I'm actually an ENFP personality.

906
00:57:04,625 --> 00:57:05,860
Although my first week working here,

907
00:57:05,993 --> 00:57:07,261
I was getting over mono,

908
00:57:07,395 --> 00:57:08,629
so I tried to avoid infecting anyone,

909
00:57:08,763 --> 00:57:10,531
and I think I made a bad impression.

910
00:57:10,665 --> 00:57:12,066
- How'd you get mono? - I don't know.

911
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,269
But I was an RA in college, and then Kappa Delta,

912
00:57:15,403 --> 00:57:17,872
so I have no problem sharing a shower with ten other girls.

913
00:57:18,005 --> 00:57:19,240
That's how you got mono?

914
00:57:19,373 --> 00:57:20,473
No.

915
00:57:21,075 --> 00:57:22,944
I'm just saying I've always been an extrovert.

916
00:57:23,077 --> 00:57:24,045
I just love people.

917
00:57:24,178 --> 00:57:25,813
Oh.

918
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:27,748
Reception.

919
00:57:27,882 --> 00:57:28,983
Let me transfer you.

920
00:57:30,785 --> 00:57:33,254
I'm sorry, you got me babbling. Um, did you need something?

921
00:57:33,387 --> 00:57:35,222
Do you remember my friend Roman?

922
00:57:35,356 --> 00:57:37,959
Oh, my gosh, yes. He is so...

923
00:57:38,759 --> 00:57:40,127
Um, I really liked him.

924
00:57:40,261 --> 00:57:41,429
Well, we were thinking

925
00:57:41,562 --> 00:57:43,264
it might be fun to hang out sometime.

926
00:57:43,397 --> 00:57:45,266
Together. Like a double date.

927
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:48,269
And Roman would be my designated date?

928
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:50,438
Yes. Was that not clear?

929
00:57:50,571 --> 00:57:54,108
- Oh, my gosh! - Um... ...yes!

930
00:57:54,241 --> 00:57:56,243
I'm so there.

931
00:57:56,377 --> 00:57:58,079
Oh, hey, Sammy. How you doing?

932
00:57:58,212 --> 00:58:01,015
- Hey, what's up? - Nothing. Nothing.

933
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:04,919
It was cool running into you this weekend.

934
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:08,990
Uh, hey, what'd you think of my friend Dennis?

935
00:58:10,691 --> 00:58:12,360
- No. - Okay.

936
00:58:17,965 --> 00:58:19,633
- What is he doing here? - I ran into him again.

937
00:58:19,767 --> 00:58:20,935
You told me you thought he was attractive.

938
00:58:21,068 --> 00:58:22,269
What happened to Sammy? Sammy was great.

939
00:58:22,403 --> 00:58:23,537
Sammy said that he thought you were cute,

940
00:58:23,671 --> 00:58:24,772
but that he doesn't do cute.

941
00:58:24,905 --> 00:58:26,440
- I can't do this! - Yes, you can.

942
00:58:26,574 --> 00:58:27,975
I explained everything.

943
00:58:28,109 --> 00:58:30,277
He knows you're not really from London.

944
00:58:36,751 --> 00:58:38,285
I'm allergic to shellfish,

945
00:58:38,419 --> 00:58:40,688
I once fell off a ski lift...

946
00:58:40,821 --> 00:58:43,157
...um, and I've never been

947
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:45,793
- to another country. - Nobody falls off a ski lift.

948
00:58:45,926 --> 00:58:47,661
Everybody's been to another country.

949
00:58:48,262 --> 00:58:49,997
- I've been to Canada one time. - Okay.

950
00:58:50,131 --> 00:58:52,233
Oh, gosh. Okay, you got me.

951
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:55,136
Wait. Um, so how did you fall off a ski lift?

952
00:58:55,269 --> 00:58:56,837
Uh, we were kids, we took a Christmas trip

953
00:58:56,971 --> 00:58:59,740
to Sun Valley once, and Rocky dropped his glove,

954
00:58:59,874 --> 00:59:01,809
and I reached for it and tried to grab it.

955
00:59:01,942 --> 00:59:03,144
Yeah.

956
00:59:03,277 --> 00:59:05,813
Head first, ten, 15 feet.

957
00:59:05,946 --> 00:59:08,349
Uh, I remember just hearing this snap in my wrist.

958
00:59:08,482 --> 00:59:10,151
- Jesus. - Yeah.

959
00:59:10,284 --> 00:59:12,521
- I love skiing. - Oh, no way. You like skiing?

960
00:59:12,653 --> 00:59:13,721
Yeah, yeah. I-I ski.

961
00:59:13,854 --> 00:59:15,356
- Um, I'm from Michigan. - That's cool.

962
00:59:15,489 --> 00:59:16,857
- You don't even have an accent. - Okay, my turn.

963
00:59:16,991 --> 00:59:20,061
I can't whistle, I once traded my cat Noodles

964
00:59:20,194 --> 00:59:22,763
for my neighbor's Princess Diana Beanie Baby.

965
00:59:22,897 --> 00:59:24,331
The deal was revoked hours later.

966
00:59:24,465 --> 00:59:27,468
And what else, what else? Um, oh.

967
00:59:27,635 --> 00:59:30,404
I auditioned for <i>The Real World...</i>

968
00:59:30,571 --> 00:59:32,273
<i>...San Diego</i> when I was in college.

969
00:59:32,406 --> 00:59:35,876
Mm, your second one is too specific to be a lie.

970
00:59:36,043 --> 00:59:38,712
And you didn't audition for <i>Real World.</i>

971
00:59:38,846 --> 00:59:40,581
Yeah, you hesitated before that last one.

972
00:59:40,714 --> 00:59:42,450
- I think that's... that's probably the lie. - Yeah.

973
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:45,753
I think you can whistle, right?

974
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,355
- I've never had a cat. - Oh, my God!

975
00:59:48,489 --> 00:59:50,224
- What? - You are so good at this.

976
00:59:50,357 --> 00:59:52,093
Yeah. Well, the trick is to say something

977
00:59:52,226 --> 00:59:56,531
that is emotionally true but factually false.

978
00:59:58,265 --> 01:00:00,535
- Yeah. - Okay, um, my turn.

979
01:00:00,668 --> 01:00:02,136
Uh, when I was ten,

980
01:00:02,269 --> 01:00:05,574
I almost lost a testicle in a diving board accident...

981
01:00:20,421 --> 01:00:21,755
You know, I used to feel...

982
01:00:25,659 --> 01:00:29,296
I don't wanna say "superior" to singletons, but...

983
01:00:32,366 --> 01:00:33,901
Yeah, like, I felt bad for them.

984
01:00:35,769 --> 01:00:37,506
And now, I'm just like everybody else.

985
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,441
Except worse.

986
01:00:41,876 --> 01:00:42,843
Because I know.

987
01:00:46,548 --> 01:00:48,782
I see twins everywhere I go.

988
01:00:49,618 --> 01:00:51,252
My bar, my park.

989
01:00:51,986 --> 01:00:53,487
I had to switch juiceries,

990
01:00:53,622 --> 01:00:56,290
because my go-to hired twin cashiers.

991
01:00:56,790 --> 01:00:57,892
- Hi, boys. - Hey.

992
01:00:58,025 --> 01:00:59,360
- And good morning. - Morning.

993
01:00:59,493 --> 01:01:00,961
I snuck it past security.

994
01:01:01,095 --> 01:01:03,797
- My God, you're so naughty. - No, I didn't.

995
01:01:03,931 --> 01:01:05,933
- I just asked really politely. - Oh.

996
01:01:06,066 --> 01:01:07,468
I would've brought you one, but Roman says

997
01:01:07,602 --> 01:01:08,836
you don't drink coffee.

998
01:01:08,969 --> 01:01:10,971
Yeah, coffee's bad for your teeth. I drink tea.

999
01:01:12,574 --> 01:01:14,375
You know, tea actually contains

1000
01:01:14,509 --> 01:01:16,010
a higher tannin content than coffee,

1001
01:01:16,143 --> 01:01:18,112
so it's more likely to stain your teeth.

1002
01:01:18,245 --> 01:01:19,680
- Interesting fact! - I didn't know that.

1003
01:01:19,813 --> 01:01:22,651
- Yeah. - Starbucks sells tea, FYI.

1004
01:01:22,783 --> 01:01:24,151
Oh, I brew my own coffee.

1005
01:01:24,285 --> 01:01:26,320
I just really like their travel mugs.

1006
01:01:30,024 --> 01:01:31,626
- You look really cute today. - Thanks, baby.

1007
01:02:00,387 --> 01:02:01,755
Oh, Dennis.

1008
01:02:01,889 --> 01:02:03,357
I saw a pair of twins at the gym yesterday,

1009
01:02:03,490 --> 01:02:06,026
and then I saw another pair of twins on my walk home.

1010
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,928
It's like they're everywhere.

1011
01:02:08,062 --> 01:02:10,197
- That's the frequency illusion. - What?

1012
01:02:10,331 --> 01:02:12,601
Also known as the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon.

1013
01:02:12,733 --> 01:02:14,669
It's like when I got my navy blue Prius.

1014
01:02:14,802 --> 01:02:17,004
Suddenly, I was seeing navy blue Prii everywhere,

1015
01:02:17,137 --> 01:02:19,273
but they'd always been there, I just wasn't paying attention.

1016
01:02:19,406 --> 01:02:22,076
You are so smart today. I mean, you're smart every day,

1017
01:02:22,209 --> 01:02:23,678
- but especially today. - No!

1018
01:02:23,811 --> 01:02:25,112
I was a psychology major.

1019
01:02:25,246 --> 01:02:27,181
That's why you're a receptionist.

1020
01:02:27,314 --> 01:02:28,617
'Cause you're so good with people.

1021
01:02:28,749 --> 01:02:30,918
Thanks, Dennis.

1022
01:02:31,051 --> 01:02:34,221
Anyway, it, uh, reminded me of the discussion we had in group.

1023
01:02:34,689 --> 01:02:36,123
What group?

1024
01:02:36,257 --> 01:02:38,058
The support group I'm always talking about.

1025
01:02:38,727 --> 01:02:41,028
Wait, does Dennis have a twin?

1026
01:02:41,161 --> 01:02:44,064
Yeah, that's how we met. I thought I told you this.

1027
01:02:44,198 --> 01:02:45,266
No, I...

1028
01:02:45,866 --> 01:02:47,535
Dennis, you told me you were an only child.

1029
01:02:47,669 --> 01:02:49,303
- Mm, I didn't tell you that. - Yeah, yeah!

1030
01:02:49,436 --> 01:02:50,739
It was bagel Friday.

1031
01:02:50,871 --> 01:02:52,707
I remember, because I'm an only child too,

1032
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,408
and-and we're both Leos.

1033
01:02:54,542 --> 01:02:57,278
Well, I am an only child now,

1034
01:02:57,411 --> 01:02:59,880
because my twin, Dean, died, and it's very personal,

1035
01:03:00,014 --> 01:03:02,216
so I guess I didn't feel comfortable telling you that.

1036
01:03:02,783 --> 01:03:04,451
- I'm so sorry. - It's fine.

1037
01:03:04,586 --> 01:03:07,756
It's okay.

1038
01:03:07,888 --> 01:03:09,890
You know, I feel like such a doofus,

1039
01:03:10,024 --> 01:03:11,726
because there was that one time at work

1040
01:03:11,892 --> 01:03:14,228
a couple of months ago, and I didn't want to pry,

1041
01:03:14,361 --> 01:03:15,796
but you were so sad,

1042
01:03:15,929 --> 01:03:18,465
and-and you were kind of hard to understand,

1043
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:19,933
but you were saying something about

1044
01:03:20,067 --> 01:03:21,969
how the love of your life had been hit by a--

1045
01:03:22,102 --> 01:03:25,640
No! Stop!

1046
01:03:25,774 --> 01:03:27,241
- Dennis? - You okay, man?

1047
01:03:27,374 --> 01:03:29,977
Uh, I-I need to get out of here! I'm-I'm claustrophobic,

1048
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:31,979
and I don't wanna talk about Dean!

1049
01:03:32,112 --> 01:03:33,782
I think he's having an anxiety attack.

1050
01:03:33,914 --> 01:03:36,518
Yes! I-I'm having an anxiety attack!

1051
01:03:36,651 --> 01:03:40,522
Anxiety attack! Anxiety attack!

1052
01:03:48,797 --> 01:03:51,131
- Hey. - So, I spoke with Sharon, the manager--

1053
01:03:51,265 --> 01:03:52,701
Oh, she's a sweetheart.

1054
01:03:52,833 --> 01:03:54,301
Do we want credit or a refund?

1055
01:03:55,069 --> 01:03:56,270
- Refund. - Credit.

1056
01:03:59,774 --> 01:04:01,041
<i>Jonny died.</i>

1057
01:04:02,176 --> 01:04:03,344
My dog.

1058
01:04:04,111 --> 01:04:07,114
I shouldn't have named him after my brother.

1059
01:04:08,182 --> 01:04:10,317
It's like he's gone all over again.

1060
01:04:11,418 --> 01:04:16,056
After... Jonny died, the real Jonny,

1061
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:18,459
I became glued to my wife.

1062
01:04:19,927 --> 01:04:22,731
She said I was trying to replace my brother...

1063
01:04:44,619 --> 01:04:46,420
- Dennis. - Maybe you should get it.

1064
01:04:46,554 --> 01:04:48,590
It's the third time. It could be an emergency!

1065
01:04:50,057 --> 01:04:52,059
Oh, my God. Shit.

1066
01:04:55,462 --> 01:04:57,766
Hey, buddy, it's late. Everything okay?

1067
01:04:57,931 --> 01:04:59,534
<i>Yeah, sorry. Did I wake you?</i>

1068
01:04:59,667 --> 01:05:01,536
No, no. Just, uh, hanging with Marcie.

1069
01:05:01,669 --> 01:05:03,671
Oh, right, Marcie. So needy.

1070
01:05:03,805 --> 01:05:07,007
- Uh, you're on speaker. - Hi, Dennis.

1071
01:05:07,141 --> 01:05:08,175
So, what's up?

1072
01:05:08,976 --> 01:05:11,445
Just wanted to see what you were doing.

1073
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:14,181
Uh, we're doing nothing, talking about Christmas

1074
01:05:14,314 --> 01:05:18,185
and stockings and all the stuff we want to stuff in them.

1075
01:05:18,318 --> 01:05:20,087
Nice. Mm.

1076
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:21,689
Are you headed home for Christmas?

1077
01:05:22,322 --> 01:05:26,260
Um, I'll be here, alone, again.

1078
01:05:26,927 --> 01:05:29,129
I mean, don't worry about me. I'm used to it.

1079
01:05:29,263 --> 01:05:30,532
I'm sure I'll find something to do.

1080
01:05:30,665 --> 01:05:32,099
You know, I've got that whole

1081
01:05:32,232 --> 01:05:34,869
unread collection of books I like to look at.

1082
01:05:36,003 --> 01:05:38,205
Dennis, hang on. I'm just gonna put you on hold for a second.

1083
01:05:38,338 --> 01:05:39,473
Uh, sure.

1084
01:05:39,607 --> 01:05:40,875
Yeah, I have nothing better to do.

1085
01:05:47,715 --> 01:05:50,618
Hey, buddy, sorry that took so long. Um,

1086
01:05:51,519 --> 01:05:53,822
how'd you like to spend Christmas in Moscow?

1087
01:05:55,189 --> 01:05:56,390
Moscow, Idaho?

1088
01:05:57,224 --> 01:05:58,959
That's the one.

1089
01:06:06,366 --> 01:06:07,902
Do you have enough leg room, Dennis?

1090
01:06:08,703 --> 01:06:10,003
No.

1091
01:06:13,273 --> 01:06:15,743
- Where are the decorations? - I'm sorry, what?

1092
01:06:15,877 --> 01:06:17,846
Decorations? Where are the lights? Anything? Christmas?

1093
01:06:17,978 --> 01:06:19,848
Where are the decorations? What are you talking about?

1094
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:22,316
- Did you not even get a tree? - No, I didn't get a tree.

1095
01:06:22,449 --> 01:06:24,519
Why don't we call the fucking butler?

1096
01:06:24,652 --> 01:06:26,453
It's the holiday! Why wouldn't you get a tree?

1097
01:06:26,588 --> 01:06:29,156
Don't start with me. Please, don't start with me.

1098
01:06:29,289 --> 01:06:30,825
It's fine. Why didn't you bring a tree?

1099
01:06:30,959 --> 01:06:32,961
- I'm supposed to lug a tree? - Whose job is it?

1100
01:06:33,093 --> 01:06:34,629
- No! - It's selfish! Yes, it is!

1101
01:06:34,762 --> 01:06:36,865
Don't say that to me! How can you say that to me?

1102
01:06:36,997 --> 01:06:38,666
Because it's the fucking truth!

1103
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,768
It's not what he wanted! It's not fucking what he wanted!

1104
01:06:40,902 --> 01:06:42,804
You don't know that. You don't know everything.

1105
01:06:42,937 --> 01:06:45,005
Yes, I do! Everybody who fucking knew him knew that!

1106
01:06:45,138 --> 01:06:46,139
You don't know everything.

1107
01:06:46,273 --> 01:06:47,474
Do you guys want wine with dinner?

1108
01:06:47,609 --> 01:06:49,343
- Wine's good. - Yes, thank you.

1109
01:06:49,476 --> 01:06:52,981
Idaho... Hasn't even fucking lived here for ten years!

1110
01:06:55,517 --> 01:06:57,552
Do you think I was being too mean?

1111
01:06:58,987 --> 01:07:01,388
I think you're both grieving.

1112
01:07:03,925 --> 01:07:05,860
Hmm, hey, it's all right.

1113
01:07:06,861 --> 01:07:10,297
- We can still save Christmas. - What's the point?

1114
01:07:11,498 --> 01:07:13,333
If you're going to hell, keep going.

1115
01:07:14,836 --> 01:07:16,571
- "Through hell." - Hmm?

1116
01:07:17,505 --> 01:07:19,807
"If you're going through hell, keep going."

1117
01:07:20,608 --> 01:07:21,676
Because it gets better.

1118
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:24,679
It's a Winston Churchill quote.

1119
01:07:26,113 --> 01:07:27,180
Oh.

1120
01:07:27,715 --> 01:07:29,684
Yeah, that makes way more sense.

1121
01:07:31,853 --> 01:07:33,086
I knew that too.

1122
01:07:35,023 --> 01:07:36,189
Nice, buddy.

1123
01:07:38,392 --> 01:07:39,694
Would you please get up?

1124
01:07:41,228 --> 01:07:42,362
It's afternoon.

1125
01:07:46,834 --> 01:07:48,603
Mom.

1126
01:07:53,675 --> 01:07:57,244
Socks. Thanks, buddy.

1127
01:07:57,377 --> 01:07:58,846
You're welcome.

1128
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:01,114
Uh, who's next?

1129
01:08:01,248 --> 01:08:03,350
- Oh, the card's for you, Marcie. - - Oh!

1130
01:08:07,321 --> 01:08:09,891
Oh, it's a koala. I love koalas.

1131
01:08:10,858 --> 01:08:12,392
"Merry Christmas. Dennis."

1132
01:08:14,227 --> 01:08:16,631
Oh, God. A gift card to the Olive Garden.

1133
01:08:16,764 --> 01:08:18,298
I freaking love the Olive Garden.

1134
01:08:18,432 --> 01:08:19,634
How did you know?

1135
01:08:19,767 --> 01:08:21,268
I just had a feeling.

1136
01:08:21,401 --> 01:08:24,572
I am obsessed with their Toscana soup.

1137
01:08:24,706 --> 01:08:26,206
Thank you.

1138
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:27,474
- All right, babe, all right. - Yeah.

1139
01:08:27,609 --> 01:08:29,043
- Mm-hmm. - All right.

1140
01:08:29,176 --> 01:08:32,880
And, Dennis, this one's for you.

1141
01:08:34,549 --> 01:08:35,950
It's a book.

1142
01:08:55,402 --> 01:08:58,039
I thought you could, uh, redesign the cover for me.

1143
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:00,908
It's <i>The Giving Tree.</i> It's my favorite book.

1144
01:09:01,542 --> 01:09:03,111
It's the only one I've ever read twice.

1145
01:09:06,614 --> 01:09:08,082
It's an iconic cover.

1146
01:09:08,549 --> 01:09:10,283
Yeah, well, I believe in you.

1147
01:09:11,085 --> 01:09:13,788
I don't get it. Um, why are you giving Dennis homework?

1148
01:09:13,921 --> 01:09:16,124
Oh. It's his, uh, dream to be a book designer.

1149
01:09:16,256 --> 01:09:17,825
- Really? That's neat. - Yeah.

1150
01:09:17,959 --> 01:09:19,027
I didn't know.

1151
01:09:19,961 --> 01:09:21,596
I thought you wanted to be a lawyer.

1152
01:09:21,729 --> 01:09:23,031
No, I hate lawyers.

1153
01:09:24,098 --> 01:09:26,166
Then why were you studying for the LSAT?

1154
01:09:28,569 --> 01:09:29,804
For fun.

1155
01:09:30,838 --> 01:09:33,273
Oh, why would that be fun if you hate lawyers?

1156
01:09:33,975 --> 01:09:36,276
I don't know, Marcie. Why do people walk on hot coals?

1157
01:09:36,410 --> 01:09:38,646
So they can say they did.

1158
01:09:43,283 --> 01:09:45,119
- Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.

1159
01:09:47,354 --> 01:09:49,356
Do you know when Dennis's twin died?

1160
01:09:49,489 --> 01:09:50,457
Dean?

1161
01:09:51,159 --> 01:09:54,829
Um, I think a year ago, year and a half maybe.

1162
01:09:55,663 --> 01:09:56,998
Did he live in Portland?

1163
01:09:58,132 --> 01:09:59,834
Dennis said he worked for the IRS.

1164
01:09:59,967 --> 01:10:01,301
Is the IRS in Portland?

1165
01:10:01,435 --> 01:10:03,403
- Oh, the IRS is everywhere, baby. - Oh.

1166
01:10:04,172 --> 01:10:06,206
- Why do you ask? - No reason.

1167
01:10:18,052 --> 01:10:19,687
- Where is he? - Oh, my God.

1168
01:10:20,822 --> 01:10:23,356
They went hiking. They said they'd be back after sunset.

1169
01:10:29,797 --> 01:10:31,231
You like Pokémon?

1170
01:10:32,499 --> 01:10:35,069
Yeah. I like Pokémon.

1171
01:10:35,203 --> 01:10:37,705
Rocky and Roman loved those cards.

1172
01:10:37,839 --> 01:10:39,406
All they could talk about.

1173
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:41,374
I spent so much fucking money on them.

1174
01:10:43,144 --> 01:10:44,779
And then Rocky just left.

1175
01:10:44,912 --> 01:10:46,881
He couldn't be bothered to take his shit with him.

1176
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:51,586
I'm like a storage unit.

1177
01:10:53,821 --> 01:10:54,956
Do you want 'em?

1178
01:10:56,657 --> 01:10:59,560
Yeah, I-- If you don't want them, I can take them.

1179
01:11:04,331 --> 01:11:06,134
Roman said you lost a twin.

1180
01:11:09,336 --> 01:11:10,705
I, uh...

1181
01:11:12,573 --> 01:11:13,908
did, yes.

1182
01:11:17,410 --> 01:11:19,479
So you know what it feels like.

1183
01:11:21,015 --> 01:11:22,382
To be split.

1184
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:25,653
Hmm.

1185
01:11:30,357 --> 01:11:31,793
He doesn't talk to me.

1186
01:11:35,596 --> 01:11:38,933
They say there's nothing worse than losing a child.

1187
01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:44,172
But maybe there is.

1188
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:52,412
I'm glad he has someone who understands.

1189
01:12:17,071 --> 01:12:19,339
I'm heading out. Before you leave,

1190
01:12:19,472 --> 01:12:22,009
Marcie wants to see you in the conference room.

1191
01:12:22,143 --> 01:12:23,978
- Why? - I didn't ask.

1192
01:12:24,111 --> 01:12:26,180
Okay. Have fun at the concert.

1193
01:12:26,314 --> 01:12:28,282
Thanks.

1194
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:31,853
Did I tell you I was going to a concert?

1195
01:12:33,254 --> 01:12:34,288
Yes.

1196
01:12:52,173 --> 01:12:53,975
Thank you for agreeing to meet with me.

1197
01:12:55,176 --> 01:12:56,811
I need to talk to you, Dennis.

1198
01:13:00,948 --> 01:13:02,482
Okay, well, I have somewhere I have to be.

1199
01:13:02,617 --> 01:13:04,352
You don't really have a twin, do you?

1200
01:13:05,887 --> 01:13:07,922
Roman mentioned that Dean passed away,

1201
01:13:08,055 --> 01:13:10,591
like, a year and a half ago, and that didn't make sense

1202
01:13:10,725 --> 01:13:13,361
because I knew you, like, a year and a half ago, and I should've known that.

1203
01:13:13,493 --> 01:13:15,696
And you don't have photos of him on Instagram,

1204
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:17,732
and I thought, "Well, that's strange,

1205
01:13:17,865 --> 01:13:21,068
but maybe he deleted them."

1206
01:13:21,202 --> 01:13:24,404
So, yesterday, I texted my friend Sheri at the IRS,

1207
01:13:24,538 --> 01:13:26,841
and she said there was no Dean Benver in their records.

1208
01:13:26,974 --> 01:13:28,542
And then last night, I called Kevin Ross,

1209
01:13:28,676 --> 01:13:30,011
who I saw you went to high school with.

1210
01:13:30,144 --> 01:13:31,779
I met him in an oil painting class,

1211
01:13:31,913 --> 01:13:33,614
and he said you didn't have a brother

1212
01:13:33,748 --> 01:13:36,717
and he's 100 percent sure because you sat alone at lunch every day

1213
01:13:36,851 --> 01:13:38,386
and his mom made him go to your birthday party

1214
01:13:38,519 --> 01:13:40,288
and no one else showed up and you have a twin bed,

1215
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:42,455
but just one, and he also made it sound like

1216
01:13:42,590 --> 01:13:44,091
you fooled around in it, but I couldn't be sure

1217
01:13:44,225 --> 01:13:45,393
'cause I heard his wife in the background--

1218
01:13:45,526 --> 01:13:46,661
Why are you spying on me?

1219
01:13:46,794 --> 01:13:48,596
Did you know Roman's brother Rocky?

1220
01:13:49,530 --> 01:13:52,366
- No. - I don't believe you.

1221
01:13:52,499 --> 01:13:55,636
Let it go.

1222
01:13:55,770 --> 01:13:59,140
Roman thinks you met because you lost a twin.

1223
01:13:59,273 --> 01:14:01,809
A twin that doesn't even exist.

1224
01:14:01,943 --> 01:14:03,411
You can't keep this from him, Dennis.

1225
01:14:03,544 --> 01:14:04,812
He has to know the truth.

1226
01:14:04,946 --> 01:14:06,747
I will tell him when I'm ready.

1227
01:14:06,881 --> 01:14:08,549
You need to tell him now or I will.

1228
01:14:08,683 --> 01:14:10,384
You're not telling him, Marcie.

1229
01:14:10,518 --> 01:14:11,919
I mean, God, you have everything.

1230
01:14:12,053 --> 01:14:13,721
Everybody likes you, you have a million friends,

1231
01:14:13,854 --> 01:14:15,222
you have both your parents.

1232
01:14:15,356 --> 01:14:17,325
I bet none of your houseplants ever fucking die.

1233
01:14:18,259 --> 01:14:19,994
Let me have one good thing.

1234
01:14:20,761 --> 01:14:22,596
I'm happy. He's happy. I help him.

1235
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:24,165
When he needed somebody to talk to at 3:00

1236
01:14:24,298 --> 01:14:25,833
in the morning, I'm the one who picked up the phone.

1237
01:14:25,967 --> 01:14:27,401
Where the fuck were you then, huh?

1238
01:14:27,535 --> 01:14:29,570
You wouldn't even know Roman if it wasn't for me.

1239
01:14:32,974 --> 01:14:34,842
What do you expect me to do?

1240
01:14:41,215 --> 01:14:43,117
I know I need to tell him. I just...

1241
01:14:45,219 --> 01:14:46,787
I want a little bit more time.

1242
01:14:48,923 --> 01:14:50,024
Please.

1243
01:15:26,293 --> 01:15:28,629
She said she couldn't see me this weekend.

1244
01:15:29,363 --> 01:15:30,965
Then she kept apologizing

1245
01:15:31,098 --> 01:15:33,200
and said that I should talk to you.

1246
01:15:34,168 --> 01:15:36,470
I mean, are you sure she didn't say anything?

1247
01:15:38,172 --> 01:15:39,740
Oh, you know what? I totally forgot

1248
01:15:39,874 --> 01:15:43,544
we're doing this company-wide fundraiser for MS research,

1249
01:15:43,677 --> 01:15:45,579
and Marcie took a vow of silence.

1250
01:15:46,313 --> 01:15:47,748
- Really? - Hmm.

1251
01:15:48,282 --> 01:15:49,717
Why wouldn't she just tell me that?

1252
01:15:50,718 --> 01:15:52,553
We had to sign nondisclosure agreements.

1253
01:15:53,354 --> 01:15:54,321
Oh.

1254
01:15:56,023 --> 01:15:56,991
Okay.

1255
01:15:58,527 --> 01:15:59,994
<i>Oops. I guess I missed you.</i>

1256
01:16:00,161 --> 01:16:01,862
<i>I promise to call you back ASAP.</i>

1257
01:16:02,029 --> 01:16:03,497
<i>I hope you're having a wonderful day.</i>

1258
01:16:03,631 --> 01:16:05,733
Hey, it's me.

1259
01:16:06,801 --> 01:16:09,403
Just, uh... I know you can't talk

1260
01:16:09,538 --> 01:16:12,507
'cause you're saving lives.

1261
01:16:19,914 --> 01:16:21,215
Roman?

1262
01:16:22,517 --> 01:16:24,452
Roman.

1263
01:16:25,186 --> 01:16:26,220
Hey.

1264
01:16:26,353 --> 01:16:27,955
Someone cracked the bourbon.

1265
01:16:28,557 --> 01:16:29,957
Mm, ooh.

1266
01:16:30,691 --> 01:16:33,894
Well, I started without you 'cause I was bored.

1267
01:16:34,028 --> 01:16:35,196
I'm gonna hop in the shower.

1268
01:16:35,329 --> 01:16:36,397
No, don't.

1269
01:16:36,531 --> 01:16:38,766
You already left me alone for so long.

1270
01:16:39,834 --> 01:16:41,302
Oh, wow, you are drunk.

1271
01:16:41,435 --> 01:16:42,436
Wow.

1272
01:16:43,337 --> 01:16:44,772
Uh, here.

1273
01:16:44,905 --> 01:16:46,941
I poured you one.

1274
01:16:48,709 --> 01:16:50,311
I didn't put anything in it.

1275
01:16:50,444 --> 01:16:53,314
I could've though. You never know. You don't know me.

1276
01:16:56,917 --> 01:16:59,153
Thanks.

1277
01:17:03,057 --> 01:17:05,159
God, these fucking shoes are killing me.

1278
01:17:05,292 --> 01:17:07,161
I think my feet got bigger.

1279
01:17:07,294 --> 01:17:09,263
Mmm. Well, you know what that means.

1280
01:17:11,765 --> 01:17:13,434
- What? - Nothing.

1281
01:17:13,568 --> 01:17:14,935
Do you want a foot massage?

1282
01:17:15,069 --> 01:17:17,238
- Uh, nah, I'm okay. - Are you sure?

1283
01:17:17,371 --> 01:17:18,939
I'm super good.

1284
01:17:19,073 --> 01:17:21,175
I went to massage training school

1285
01:17:21,308 --> 01:17:22,776
in college in the summer.

1286
01:17:25,446 --> 01:17:27,081
Okay. Yeah, mm.

1287
01:17:27,915 --> 01:17:29,083
Maybe it'll help.

1288
01:17:29,216 --> 01:17:30,651
Yeah, I bet it will.

1289
01:17:31,952 --> 01:17:33,354
Come on over.

1290
01:17:34,421 --> 01:17:35,956
The bed is fine.

1291
01:17:40,794 --> 01:17:43,297
- Just like this? - Yeah.

1292
01:17:44,899 --> 01:17:47,101
Sorry, man. I bet my foot smells like death.

1293
01:17:47,234 --> 01:17:48,869
Mmm. I don't mind.

1294
01:17:52,973 --> 01:17:54,141
Oh, wow.

1295
01:17:56,911 --> 01:17:58,279
Oh, shit, you are good at that.

1296
01:17:58,412 --> 01:18:01,982
Just drink your drink.

1297
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:05,052
All right, hold your hippos.

1298
01:18:07,188 --> 01:18:08,389
What did you say?

1299
01:18:10,324 --> 01:18:12,393
"Hold your hippos." It's like, uh...

1300
01:18:13,027 --> 01:18:14,995
it's like "hold your horses," but...

1301
01:18:15,496 --> 01:18:16,830
It's just something Rocky and I say.

1302
01:18:18,199 --> 01:18:19,166
Oh.

1303
01:18:21,435 --> 01:18:23,304
Did you and Dean ever have anything like that?

1304
01:18:25,507 --> 01:18:26,473
Um...

1305
01:18:28,475 --> 01:18:29,910
"Jinx, you owe me a soda."

1306
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:33,380
Right, but everyone says that.

1307
01:18:33,847 --> 01:18:38,018
Well, we started it. Yeah.

1308
01:18:45,192 --> 01:18:48,329
Oh, yeah. That's the fucking spot.

1309
01:18:49,863 --> 01:18:53,434
Ooh. Wow. That's really good.

1310
01:18:55,570 --> 01:18:56,770
Mmm.

1311
01:18:58,072 --> 01:18:59,073
Oh.

1312
01:19:00,407 --> 01:19:04,044
This is actually really helping.

1313
01:19:12,353 --> 01:19:13,555
Oh, wow.

1314
01:19:14,355 --> 01:19:18,192
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

1315
01:19:23,864 --> 01:19:26,433
What are you doing?

1316
01:19:26,568 --> 01:19:28,936
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What the fuck was that?

1317
01:19:29,069 --> 01:19:32,641
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

1318
01:19:32,773 --> 01:19:35,075
I don't know if they teach that, like, in-in massage school,

1319
01:19:35,209 --> 01:19:38,078
but I'm just, uh, I'm not into that. So...

1320
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:41,750
I'm sorry. It's just...

1321
01:19:41,882 --> 01:19:44,418
You look so much like him.

1322
01:19:44,552 --> 01:19:45,754
Like who?

1323
01:19:45,886 --> 01:19:47,921
Oh, I don't want you to hate me.

1324
01:19:48,055 --> 01:19:49,758
I don't hate you. It's not a big deal, you know?

1325
01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:51,292
Just don't do it again.

1326
01:19:51,425 --> 01:19:54,295
Yeah, if I tell you, you're gonna hate me,

1327
01:19:54,428 --> 01:19:56,397
and then it's gonna be over.

1328
01:19:56,531 --> 01:19:59,166
What are you talking about? Why... why would I hate you?

1329
01:20:01,569 --> 01:20:03,003
Because, um...

1330
01:20:04,204 --> 01:20:06,675
I don't have a twin, and Dean isn't real.

1331
01:20:07,941 --> 01:20:08,909
Wha--

1332
01:20:10,578 --> 01:20:12,681
What do you mean? What do you mean he isn't real?

1333
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:16,518
I made him up. He doesn't exist.

1334
01:20:18,419 --> 01:20:20,154
What the fuck are you talking about?

1335
01:20:20,622 --> 01:20:22,189
Why are you in the support group?

1336
01:20:22,323 --> 01:20:24,825
I just started following you.

1337
01:20:25,392 --> 01:20:28,362
I thought it was a sign, and I kept trying to tell you,

1338
01:20:28,495 --> 01:20:30,931
but I-- I mean, how do you say...

1339
01:20:31,065 --> 01:20:32,833
Oh, I was in love with your brother.

1340
01:20:32,966 --> 01:20:34,602
Except it wasn't really love because I only knew him

1341
01:20:34,736 --> 01:20:36,638
for a day, but at the time, that felt like enough, and...

1342
01:20:36,771 --> 01:20:39,507
And I was the crazy guy in-in the intersection,

1343
01:20:39,641 --> 01:20:41,141
and, you know, it wasn't technically my fault,

1344
01:20:41,275 --> 01:20:42,777
but if he never met me, he'd probably still be alive,

1345
01:20:42,910 --> 01:20:44,945
and it was the worst day of my life and...

1346
01:20:45,079 --> 01:20:46,380
I don't know why I kept lying.

1347
01:20:46,514 --> 01:20:48,449
I just... I wanted to be close to you,

1348
01:20:48,583 --> 01:20:49,718
and I thought I could make it better,

1349
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:51,051
but I just kept making things worse.

1350
01:20:51,185 --> 01:20:52,687
And-and Marcie isn't on a silent retreat,

1351
01:20:52,821 --> 01:20:55,690
and I... I didn't go to massage school, but...

1352
01:20:55,824 --> 01:20:58,492
You are my best friend.

1353
01:20:59,293 --> 01:21:02,496
And I don't want that to change.

1354
01:21:07,101 --> 01:21:08,636
I don't know what to do.

1355
01:21:11,105 --> 01:21:12,339
Do you hate me?

1356
01:21:15,844 --> 01:21:18,979
Roman? Please say something.

1357
01:21:20,013 --> 01:21:24,552
Roman. Do you hate me?

1358
01:21:26,186 --> 01:21:27,555
Don't fucking touch me.

1359
01:21:27,689 --> 01:21:29,657
Roman, please. I... I'm sorry.

1360
01:21:29,791 --> 01:21:31,892
Don't fucking touch me!

1361
01:22:14,736 --> 01:22:16,871
I just kept hitting him.

1362
01:22:18,873 --> 01:22:20,140
Couldn't stop.

1363
01:22:39,694 --> 01:22:41,863
<i>Hi, Dennis. It's Marcie.</i>

1364
01:22:42,029 --> 01:22:45,299
<i>So you're not at work. Sage asked me to call you.</i>

1365
01:22:45,432 --> 01:22:47,234
<i>Are you coming in today?</i>

1366
01:22:47,301 --> 01:22:49,871
<i>Look, Roman's pretty upset.</i>

1367
01:22:50,037 --> 01:22:51,573
<i>He wants you to stop calling him,</i>

1368
01:22:51,739 --> 01:22:53,474
<i>and he doesn't want me talking to you either,</i>

1369
01:22:53,641 --> 01:22:55,309
<i>but I'll be thinking of you.</i>

1370
01:23:02,449 --> 01:23:04,886
<i>Do you see what... I see?</i>

1371
01:23:05,052 --> 01:23:09,122
<i>I don't know what you see, but what I see is me.</i>

1372
01:23:09,289 --> 01:23:10,424
<i>I see me too.</i>

1373
01:23:10,592 --> 01:23:12,961
<i>Does that mean there's two of you</i>

1374
01:23:13,126 --> 01:23:15,128
<i>or... or two of me?</i>

1375
01:23:19,667 --> 01:23:20,635
<i>Oh.</i>

1376
01:23:23,136 --> 01:23:24,739
<i>Wow.</i>

1377
01:23:24,906 --> 01:23:27,007
<i>There really is two of us.</i>

1378
01:23:27,140 --> 01:23:28,810
<i>Don't you find this odd?</i>

1379
01:23:28,977 --> 01:23:31,178
<i>No, this is weird.</i>

1380
01:23:31,345 --> 01:23:34,716
<i>This is really, really weird.</i>

1381
01:23:34,782 --> 01:23:38,085
<i>Wait a sec. You live at the Callaway house.</i>

1382
01:23:38,252 --> 01:23:40,955
<i>And you're that girl from camp.</i>

1383
01:23:41,088 --> 01:23:43,457
<i>They thought I was you!</i>

1384
01:23:44,626 --> 01:23:46,828
So who'd like to start today?

1385
01:23:54,434 --> 01:23:57,371
Okay, if no one's gonna say it, then I'll say it.

1386
01:23:57,504 --> 01:24:01,041
Roman sent us all an email that said you made Dean up,

1387
01:24:01,174 --> 01:24:02,911
and I think that you're a fucking creep.

1388
01:24:03,043 --> 01:24:05,345
Is this true, Dennis?

1389
01:24:11,385 --> 01:24:14,054
True? Uh, I mean...

1390
01:24:14,187 --> 01:24:16,824
Technically... it's true,

1391
01:24:16,958 --> 01:24:19,827
but I-I've always felt so connected to all of you,

1392
01:24:19,961 --> 01:24:22,496
and I've always wanted a twin.

1393
01:24:22,630 --> 01:24:25,265
Sometimes Dean felt real.

1394
01:24:25,833 --> 01:24:27,669
His favorite snack is a hot pretzel

1395
01:24:27,802 --> 01:24:29,269
with sea salt and...

1396
01:24:29,971 --> 01:24:33,206
You know, maybe twin identity is really just a construct,

1397
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:35,877
like gender.

1398
01:24:36,010 --> 01:24:39,714
Oh, okay. Or it's maybe not. Um...

1399
01:24:42,482 --> 01:24:45,753
I was reading about vanishing twin syndrome.

1400
01:24:46,654 --> 01:24:48,056
Because I've always thought

1401
01:24:48,188 --> 01:24:51,025
there was something or someone missing.

1402
01:24:51,659 --> 01:24:57,230
And it's possible that I had a twin in my mother's womb,

1403
01:24:57,364 --> 01:24:59,132
but I ate him.

1404
01:24:59,934 --> 01:25:03,538
And I'd ask her, but I can't because she's dead.

1405
01:25:04,404 --> 01:25:06,139
Really dead. She's real.

1406
01:25:08,375 --> 01:25:10,410
We believe you got a mom.

1407
01:25:12,179 --> 01:25:13,280
I don't.

1408
01:25:48,616 --> 01:25:50,652
Excuse me. Can you take a picture of us?

1409
01:25:52,386 --> 01:25:55,657
No. No, I can't. You have no idea how lucky you are.

1410
01:25:55,790 --> 01:25:57,825
Well, sorry we asked.

1411
01:26:09,302 --> 01:26:10,470
Fuck.

1412
01:26:14,108 --> 01:26:15,677
What are you looking for?

1413
01:26:15,810 --> 01:26:18,311
I can't find Rocky's sweater. Uh...

1414
01:26:19,346 --> 01:26:21,716
The one with the-- with the stripes, the...

1415
01:26:21,849 --> 01:26:23,316
Did you move it? Did you put it somewhere?

1416
01:26:23,450 --> 01:26:24,719
No, I didn't touch it.

1417
01:26:25,987 --> 01:26:28,221
I bet Dennis stole it, that fake twin fucker.

1418
01:26:29,757 --> 01:26:30,792
I'm sure it'll turn up.

1419
01:26:30,925 --> 01:26:32,359
Yeah, how the fuck do you know that?

1420
01:26:37,131 --> 01:26:38,066
I'm sorry.

1421
01:26:38,198 --> 01:26:39,167
You can't talk to me like that.

1422
01:26:39,299 --> 01:26:40,735
I know. I'm sorry.

1423
01:26:41,468 --> 01:26:43,236
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1424
01:26:46,974 --> 01:26:48,176
I forgive you.

1425
01:26:51,145 --> 01:26:52,547
I don't deserve it.

1426
01:26:54,716 --> 01:26:57,484
Deservedness is not a requisite for forgiveness.

1427
01:27:03,457 --> 01:27:05,560
I'll help you look.

1428
01:27:44,098 --> 01:27:46,200
- Not right now. - When?

1429
01:27:48,102 --> 01:27:51,239
- Thirty more minutes. - You said that 30 minutes ago.

1430
01:27:51,371 --> 01:27:54,374
Well, think of it like

1431
01:27:55,176 --> 01:27:58,378
edging.

1432
01:28:02,917 --> 01:28:05,987
Oh, no.

1433
01:28:16,531 --> 01:28:18,398
What do you want to do for dinner tonight?

1434
01:28:18,533 --> 01:28:20,134
Oh, I'm going to Shelly's, remember?

1435
01:28:20,802 --> 01:28:23,237
Oh. Forgot.

1436
01:28:26,741 --> 01:28:27,775
Can I come?

1437
01:28:28,308 --> 01:28:29,744
It's girls' night.

1438
01:28:29,877 --> 01:28:32,412
- We talked about this. - Okay. Fine.

1439
01:28:32,547 --> 01:28:35,750
- Don't mope. - I'm not moping.

1440
01:29:22,597 --> 01:29:24,497
Sorry, there was a line.

1441
01:29:24,632 --> 01:29:25,733
I can't stay long.

1442
01:29:31,606 --> 01:29:33,307
- Thank you. - Sure thing.

1443
01:29:34,876 --> 01:29:36,711
Sorry, I shouldn't have ordered anything.

1444
01:29:38,779 --> 01:29:41,148
- Do you want my sandwich? - No, I'm good.

1445
01:29:51,893 --> 01:29:53,928
- I got a promotion. Oh. - How are you?

1446
01:29:54,896 --> 01:29:55,863
Congrats.

1447
01:29:56,831 --> 01:30:00,368
Thanks. Sort of. It's a ladder move.

1448
01:30:01,669 --> 01:30:02,870
Lateral move?

1449
01:30:03,738 --> 01:30:06,040
- What? - Lateral.

1450
01:30:06,173 --> 01:30:07,875
Means you're moving sideways.

1451
01:30:08,509 --> 01:30:09,710
I guess you could have a sideways ladder,

1452
01:30:09,844 --> 01:30:11,879
but I can't think of a use for it.

1453
01:30:13,547 --> 01:30:14,515
Fuck.

1454
01:30:16,050 --> 01:30:18,586
I said "ladder move" to, like, so many people.

1455
01:30:20,688 --> 01:30:23,624
Well, monkey bars. That's a sideways ladder.

1456
01:30:24,258 --> 01:30:25,226
Great.

1457
01:30:29,563 --> 01:30:32,133
So where you working these days? Marcie said you quit.

1458
01:30:32,767 --> 01:30:34,902
Fired, but that's sweet of her.

1459
01:30:35,036 --> 01:30:37,705
I'm in the process of getting my real estate license.

1460
01:30:41,242 --> 01:30:42,977
What, no book designing?

1461
01:30:43,110 --> 01:30:45,646
I decided I'd rather be middle class and unhappy

1462
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:48,616
than poor and slightly less unhappy.

1463
01:30:48,749 --> 01:30:51,085
Yeah. Makes sense.

1464
01:30:51,686 --> 01:30:52,954
And that said, I did...

1465
01:30:57,525 --> 01:31:00,261
Wasn't sure if it was in poor taste or not, but...

1466
01:31:05,199 --> 01:31:07,134
Think it's definitely poor taste.

1467
01:31:09,070 --> 01:31:10,604
Yeah, I can see that now.

1468
01:31:11,272 --> 01:31:13,140
- I can take it... - No, no, I'll...

1469
01:31:13,274 --> 01:31:16,177
I'll keep it.

1470
01:31:24,484 --> 01:31:25,953
Did I break your arm?

1471
01:31:26,988 --> 01:31:29,623
Uh, unrelated. Sort of.

1472
01:31:31,158 --> 01:31:32,126
Sorry.

1473
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:34,595
For hitting you like I did.

1474
01:31:37,431 --> 01:31:38,666
It's all right.

1475
01:31:38,799 --> 01:31:40,935
No, it's not. I shouldn't have done that.

1476
01:31:42,937 --> 01:31:44,839
I think I outclassed you in that department.

1477
01:31:47,274 --> 01:31:48,976
Yeah, I just don't, um...

1478
01:31:51,645 --> 01:31:54,849
I don't understand how someone could...

1479
01:31:57,818 --> 01:31:59,053
I mean, who are you?

1480
01:32:03,090 --> 01:32:05,459
You know how people say "just be yourself"?

1481
01:32:08,129 --> 01:32:11,532
Like, what version of me? I hate most of them.

1482
01:32:13,801 --> 01:32:17,471
But the version of me that was just hanging out with you, I...

1483
01:32:20,174 --> 01:32:22,043
I wanted to be him all the time.

1484
01:32:31,485 --> 01:32:32,420
So, you--

1485
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:36,590
you said you were in love with Rock.

1486
01:32:38,192 --> 01:32:39,927
With the caveat that I am insane.

1487
01:32:41,495 --> 01:32:43,064
He ever talk about me?

1488
01:32:44,799 --> 01:32:46,033
Do you want details?

1489
01:32:56,677 --> 01:32:58,079
Do you want my sandwich?

1490
01:32:58,212 --> 01:33:00,848
No, I'm going to dinner with Marcie.

1491
01:33:02,316 --> 01:33:03,617
So I can't stay long.

1492
01:33:05,352 --> 01:33:06,754
Right. You said.

1493
01:33:09,690 --> 01:33:10,958
How is Marcie, by the way?

1494
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:14,061
Every day is a good day in Marcie-land.

1495
01:33:14,195 --> 01:33:16,197
I remember.

1496
01:33:23,704 --> 01:33:25,739
I'll just have a bite.

1497
01:33:25,873 --> 01:33:28,776
Hmm.

1498
01:33:29,743 --> 01:33:31,580
I started taking karate again.

1499
01:33:34,248 --> 01:33:37,218
There's a skinny guy in my class, reminds me of you.

1500
01:33:39,420 --> 01:33:41,055
Aren't those classes useless?

1501
01:33:41,556 --> 01:33:43,724
I hear you can only really learn how to fight in the streets.

1502
01:33:45,793 --> 01:33:47,328
Well, we learn in the streets too.

1503
01:33:47,461 --> 01:33:50,998
My sensei, he, uh, follows me after work and attacks me.

1504
01:34:00,107 --> 01:34:01,308
Do you think we would've been friends

1505
01:34:01,442 --> 01:34:03,110
if we met under different circumstances?

1506
01:34:15,557 --> 01:34:16,490
I don't know.

1507
01:34:18,292 --> 01:34:19,693
I'd like to think so, but...

1508
01:34:21,829 --> 01:34:22,763
Right.

1509
01:34:27,935 --> 01:34:29,870
God, this cast is so itchy.

1510
01:34:30,639 --> 01:34:33,174
- How long you have it on for? - A month.

1511
01:34:33,908 --> 01:34:34,942
Keep it dry.

1512
01:34:39,413 --> 01:34:42,651
Rocky said you broke your own foot once.

1513
01:34:48,657 --> 01:34:49,890
He told you that?

1514
01:34:50,925 --> 01:34:52,693
You dropped a bowling ball on it?

1515
01:34:54,695 --> 01:34:57,798
He said you were... the good twin.

1516
01:35:09,511 --> 01:35:10,811
It was with a brick.

1517
01:35:16,618 --> 01:35:18,319
How are y'all doing? Can I get you anything?

1518
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:21,388
Can we get a box to go?

1519
01:35:22,189 --> 01:35:23,324
Sure thing.
