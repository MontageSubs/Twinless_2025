- 罗曼 - 我是罗基同事

7
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,670
抱歉
Sorry.

8
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,400
见你像见鬼了 抱歉 抱歉
It's like looking at a ghost. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,520
真不想待在这儿了
Have to get out of here.

节哀 我是艾瑞克
Roman. Eric.

00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:33,210
我们素未谋面 却似曾相识
We've never met, but I feel like I know you.

12
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,070
真替你难过
I'm so sorry for your loss.

13
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,030
需要的话 我都在...
I'm-I'm here if you...

14
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,980
天呐 你长得太像他了
Oh, God. Your face.

15
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,190
其实 看起来
It doesn't-- Actually, it doesn't seem like

16
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,250
不像你在尽职尽责 看起来...
you are trying to do your job. No, looks like--

17
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,030
更像是在帮倒忙
It feels like you're doing the opposite of your job

18
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,530
给我去世的哥哥
'cause it should be pretty easy to cancel

19
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,130
- 销户应该很简单的 - 还要这个吗？
- my dead brother's account. - Do you want this?

20
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,830
放哪儿好呢
I don't know.

21
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,580
妈 随便 我在打电话呢
Ma, I don't know. I'm on the phone.

22
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,040
别让我等着！
No, do not put me on hold!

23
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,410
- 这些要不要？ - 我...妈 别问了
- Do you want these? - I-- Mom, please.

24
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,350
别跟我说什么别激动！
Don't tell me to fucking calm down!

25
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,370
都耗了快一小时了
I've been on the phone for, like, an hour--

26
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,260
- 喂？操！- 罗曼
- Hello? Fuck! - Roman,

27
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,080
这些到底还要不要？
do you want me to keep these or throw them away?

28
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,150
- 非得现在收拾吗？ - 家里没地方了
- Do we have to do this now? - We don't have the room,

29
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,550
你要是想要的话...
but if you wanna keep everything--

30
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,160
- 明天再弄行吗？ - 不行
- Can we just do this tomorrow, please? - No, we can't.

31
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,760
- 为什么？ - 明天我就走人了
- Why?  - Because I'm going back tomorrow.

32
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,320
行 我又不走 别管了
Okay, but I'm gonna be here, so just leave it.

33
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,890
你真打算自己收拾吗？
You're gonna pack up this entire apartment?

34
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,280
- 对 对 - 哦 真有意思
- Yes. Yes. - Oh, that's rich.

35
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,600
我就自己来 怎么了
I'll do it myself-- What?

36
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,050
我觉得你待在这里 对你没好处
I don't think you should stay here. I don't think it's good for you.

37
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,980
得了吧 你不懂什么对我好
Oh, come on. You don't know what's good for me,

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,720
妈 从来没懂过 好吧？
Mom. You never knew what was good for me. Okay?

39
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,470
行 行
All right, Okay.

40
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,000
- 开玩笑吗？ - 好吧 那算了
- You kidding me? - Well, then never mind.

41
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,640
- 我不管了 - 很好
- I won't help you. - Good.

42
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,170
- 全部都你自己做  - 我就是这个意思
- You can do all this yourself. - That's what I'm saying.

43
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,530
- 我回酒店后 - 抓紧走
- I'll go back to the hotel. - Go.

44
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,940
- 别打电话求我 - 热烈欢送你这混蛋！
- Don't call me. - Good. Good for fucking you!

45
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,000
够了！
Time-out!

46
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,910
罗曼
Roman.

47
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,320
你需要帮助
You need help.

48
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,910
你才需要帮助
You need help.

49
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,550
嗯 确实
Well, that's true.

50
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,710
大家好
Hello, everyone.

51
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,330
现在七点了 我们开始吧
It's seven o'clock, so I say let's get started.

52
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,780
今天有几位新朋友
I see some new faces here today,

53
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,860
大家来做一个有趣的转圈轮流介绍
so I thought it would be fun to go in a circle.

54
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,350
说出你的名字
Say your name,

55
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,530
一个与名字首字相同的食物
a vegetable that starts with the same first letter

56
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:09,400
以及一件你不怀念双胞胎的事
and one thing you don't miss about your twin.

57
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,200
我先来 夏洛特 夏威夷果
Charlotte. Carrot.

58
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:16,770
我一点也不怀念夏琳抢我男朋友的事
I don't miss Claire stealing my boyfriend.

59
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,140
不 我开玩笑的
No, I'm kidding.

60
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,840
别当真 不会真这样自我介绍的
I'm kidding. We won't go in a circle.

61
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,180
但夏琳确实抢过我男朋友
But Claire, she really did steal my boyfriend.

62
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,830
他分不清我们俩 但这也算吧？
He couldn't tell us apart. But it still counts, right?

63
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,990
我怀念她的笑声
I miss her laugh.

64
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,730
我们总是一起笑
We always laughed together.

65
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,820
我们还说好要演那段阿伯特和科斯特洛的双簧
We talked about doing this Abbott and Costello routine.

66
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:41,800
{\an9}【阿伯特与科斯特洛：上世纪中叶美式喜剧二人组】

67
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,750
但我太害羞了
But I was too shy.

68
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,230
我对自己说 做单口喜剧就行了
So, I said to myself I'll try stand-up.

69
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,000
嗯 我要在你们身上试几个段子
Yep, and I'm about to test jokes on you,

70
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,490
别介意
so bear with me.

71
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,510
准备好了吗？好
Okay, you ready? All right.

72
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,080
有双胞胎的请举手
Raise your hand if you have a twin.

73
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,770
好样的
Okay.

74
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,110
来参加的双胞胎还挺多的
This is a good crowd.

75
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,680
发现没 人们总爱问
You know, so many people, they're always asking,

76
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,310
“谁更大？”
"Who's older?"

77
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,440
我最大 因为她死了
I am now that she's dead.

78
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,860
做双胞胎久了 另一半的不同
As a twin, it's like you internalize the difference

79
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,900
都会刻在你心里
between you and your other half.

80
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,960
夏琳是外向的 夏琳是更漂亮的那个
Claire's the outgoing one, Claire's the beautiful one,

81
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,680
夏琳是得性病的那个
Claire's the one with chlamydia.

82
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,270
我既气又难过
I was so upset

83
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:24,010
她得了性病居然没带上我
when she got chlamydia without me.

84
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,470
我们本该什么事都一起做
We're supposed to do everything together.

85
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,240
别吃那个 吃着像蛋蛋
Oh, I wouldn't eat that. Tastes like balls.

86
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:55,800
好 我喜欢蛋蛋
Mm, I like balls.

87
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,830
哦
Oh.

88
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,730
哎
Mm.

89
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:03,530
噢 天呐 太难吃了
Oh, my God, that's so bad.

90
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,990
你是不是...
Are you, uh...

91
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,960
我是啥？
Am I...?

92
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,670
你刚才说你喜欢蛋蛋 所以...
Oh, just-- You said you like balls, so...

93
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,870
我哥哥罗基是同性恋
Rocky, my brother, was gay.

94
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,160
你那边你兄弟也是吗？
Was your twin?

95
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,650
呃...不是
Um... No.

96
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,410
好
Right.

97
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,170
挺奇怪的 是吧？
It's weird, isn't it?

98
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,840
这叫表观遗传学
Uh, epigenetics.

99
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,980
在你的DNA之外
They're the things you inherit on top of your DNA.

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,490
影响基因表达的东西 这能解释差异
They may account for discrepancies between identical twins.

101
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,020
对了 你会晕车吗？
Hey, do you get carsick?

102
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,220
有时会 为什么问？
Sometimes. Why?

103
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,220
小时候罗基
Rocky always had to sit in the front seat

104
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,680
总要坐前排
when we were kids, and...

105
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,230
我就想
I don't know, I just thought

106
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:54,180
也许这跟所谓的 同性倾向基因 有关吧
maybe that was connected to, like, the gay gene.

107
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,950
要是有的话
If there is one.

108
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,110
不是说真有
Not that there is one.

109
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:01,870
我不是科学家 只是随便瞎猜
Uh, it was just an idea. I'm no scientist.

110
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,410
有个所谓的同性倾向基因
Um, well, there is a gay gene.

111
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,340
好像把橙当蓝 把蓝当橙
Uh, we see orange as blue and blue as orange.

112
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,230
所以时尚圈里
That's why there's so many homosexuals

113
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,540
- 同性恋多 - 哦 是吧？
- in the fashion industry. - Oh. See?

114
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,150
看吧 我就说嘛
Well, there you go.

115
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,390
抱歉 你知道我是在开玩笑吧？
I'm sorry, you know that I'm joking, right?

116
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,350
那 那不是真的
That-that's not true.

117
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,580
嗯 知道 我就知道
Yeah. No, I knew that.

118
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,480
好的
Okay.

119
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:30,120
我叫 丹 丹尼斯
I'm D-- uh, I'm Dennis.

120
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,220
我叫罗曼
Roman.

121
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,900
- 你的双胞胎叫什么名字？ - 你饿了吗？
- What was your twin's name? - Are you hungry?

122
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,600
- 抱歉 什么？ - 抱歉 我只是想问问
- Sorry, what? - Sorry. I was just gonna ask

123
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,430
如果你喜欢三明治的话
if you like sandwiches. Never mind.

124
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,810
你确定不吃点？
You sure you don't want some?

125
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,310
嗯 不吃了
Mm, I'm okay.

126
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,350
- 我想起来我吃过了 - 嗯
- I forgot I already ate. - Mm.

127
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,960
我不喝含咖啡因的 因为它会影响我
I don't drink caffeine 'cause it does things to me.

128
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,790
后来布拉德让我喝茶 花草茶
Then Brad converted me to tea. Herbal tea.

129
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,700
布拉德是我在纽约时爱上的那个男人
Brad was this guy I was in love with back in New York.

130
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,600
后来有一天我发现了很多下流视频 
Then one day, I found all these goat-fucking videos

131
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,530
- 在他浏览器的历史记录里 - 哇哦
- in his browser history. - Whoa.

132
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,700
为了不起冲突我选择了旁敲侧击
I tried to get him to confess, but I avoid conflict,

133
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,770
所以晚餐的时候 我点了山羊奶酪
so at dinner, I'd order goat cheese on an entrée,

134
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:29,680
还有他吻我脖子的时候 我就装羊咩咩的叫……
or one time when he was sucking on my neck, I bleated like...

135
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,180
看看他会有什么反应 所以我知道他知道我知道
See how he'd react. So, I know he knew I knew.

136
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,050
也许这就是他和我分手的原因吧
Maybe that's why he broke up with me.

137
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,450
他跟你分手了？
He broke up with you?

138
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,450
嗯 他是个不错的伴侣啦
Mm. He was the better catch.

139
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:43,790
我对罗基的男朋友一无所知
I don't know anything about Rocky's boyfriends.

140
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,230
我们没有真正聊起过这些事情
We didn't really talk about that stuff.

141
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,160
你们聊了些什么？
What stuff did you talk about?

142
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,530
袜子
Socks.

143
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,470
- 袜子？- 我所有的袜子都有洞
- Socks? - I get holes in all my socks.

144
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,200
我觉得是因为我经常忘记剪脚趾甲
I think it's 'cause I forget to cut my toenails.

145
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,670
罗基则觉得是因为我的东西都是在沃尔玛买的
Rocky thinks it's 'cause I shop at Walmart.

146
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,510
那是我们最后一次聊天
That was our last conversation.

147
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,980
对不起
I'm sorry.

148
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,350
又不是你的错
Not your fault.

149
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,760
你和你哥一起住吗？
So, did you live with your brother?

150
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,160
呃 不是 上大学时候是
Uh, no. Yeah, in college.

151
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,670
罗基女士去上大学了 我则留在了莫斯科
Mm. Rocky went to college. I stayed in Moscow.

152
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,740
莫斯科 爱达荷州？
Moscow, Idaho?

153
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,770
还有另一个吗？
You know another one?

154
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,240
另一个莫斯科？
Another Moscow?

155
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,110
我需要离开我妈妈的地下室
I need to get out of my mom's basement.

156
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,280
她开始向我收租金了
She started charging me rent.

157
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,450
嗯 她怎么收？
Hmm. And how's she taking it?

158
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,850
现金
Cash.

159
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,760
她人怎么样？
How is she feeling?

160
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,460
她脑子很不正常
She's a nut bucket.

161
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,530
她更喜欢罗基 所以…
Rocky was her favorite, so...

162
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,460
嗯 也没人喜欢我
Mm. I'm nobody's favorite.

163
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,530
我觉得当个双胞胎太难了
Feel like being a twin kind of fucked me.

164
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,800
小时候我从来都是自己一个人玩 你懂吧？但现在…
I never needed anyone else as a kid, you know, but now...

165
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,770
感觉我连跟餐具交朋友都会搞砸 
feel like I can't make friends with a fork.

166
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,710
一周见一两次面太少了
Once, twice a week's not enough.

167
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,550
我想有个人可以一直黏着 我…我太孤独了
I want to hang out all the time. I'm-I'm too needy.

168
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,320
我讨厌做什么都一个人
I hate doing things alone.

169
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,090
洗衣 做饭 取快递
Cooking meals, opening mail,

170
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,450
- 收衣物  - 对
- folding laundry. - Yeah.

171
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,160
两个人一起做肯定快些
So much faster with two people.

172
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,420
是吧？ 老实说
Right? I mean, honestly,

173
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,760
我觉得发明床笠的人 
whoever invented the fitted sheet

174
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,890
应该拉出来狠狠地抽一顿 
should be flagellated. And not the fun kind.

175
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,300
你懂我意思的
You get me.

176
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:52,820
罗基！
Rocky!

177
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:57,260
好久没见了 你还好吗？剪头发了吗？
Long time no see. How are you? Did you get a haircut?

178
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,160
嗯 嗯 ​​是的
Oh. Uh, yeah.

179
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,600
这太巧了
This is so random.

180
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,860
前几天我还想起你来的
I was literally thinking about you the other day.

181
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,630
我读到一篇文章 说日语里有一个词
I was reading an article about how there's a Japanese word

182
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,470
说那些在公寓里死去的人…
for people who die in their apartments...

183
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,440
- 嗯 - …死后很久
- Mm. - ...and it takes a long time

184
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,010
甚至几年才被发现
for anyone to find the body-- Years even.

185
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,470
大多是老人
Old men mostly.

186
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,880
是个很糟的社会问题
It's like a big problem over there.

187
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,280
啊 是很糟
Ah, that's awful.

188
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,380
是吧？
Isn't it?

189
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,050
反正呢 我想你知道这个
Anyway, I figured you knew this already

190
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,150
因为你以前在东京住过 是吧？
because you used to live in Tokyo, right?

191
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:25,320
对 是的
Right. Yeah.

192
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,620
是啊 这个词是怎么说来着？
Yeah, what is the word again?

193
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,820
哦 呃…
Oh, uh...

194
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,560
“阿什托阿图什”
"Ahtoatushi."

195
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,570
好像不是这个 
That doesn't sound right.

196
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,930
你好？
Hello?

197
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,400
嘿 我是罗曼
Hey. It's Roman.

198
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,600
你想和我一起去买杂货吗？
Do you wanna get groceries with me?

199
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,850
嘿 你怎么知道柠檬是否成熟了？
Hey, how do you know if lemons are ripe?

200
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,280
呃 它是黄色的 未成熟的柠檬是绿色的
Uh, it's yellow. Unripe lemons are green.

201
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,420
那么他们为什么会拿出这么多未成熟的苹果呢？
So why do they got so many unripe ones out?

202
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,020
那些是酸橙
Those are limes.

203
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,270
呃……
Uh...

204
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,540
你还好嗎？
Are you okay?

205
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,740
你能别笑我吗？
Can you not laugh at me?

206
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,940
我知道我不是最聪明的人
I know I'm not, like, the brightest tool in the shed,

207
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,480
但是...我并不欣赏
but... I don't appreciate it.

208
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,480
是的 是的 当然 对不起
Yeah. Yeah, of course. I'm sorry.

209
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:02,150
你知道 如果我错了...请告诉我
You know, if I get something wrong... tell me.

210
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,050
因为...这样我就能更了解情况了
'Cause... then I can know better.

211
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,590
现在是时候指出
Would now be a good time to point out

212
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,990
我想你的意思是“棚子里最锋利的工具？”
I think you meant to say, "sharpest tool in the shed?"

213
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,430
是的
Yeah.

214
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,440
也许你的意思是“盒子里最亮的灯泡”
Maybe you meant to say, "brightest bulb in the box."

215
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,100
- 是的 也许这就是我的意思 - 是的 是的
- Yeah, maybe that's what I meant. - Yeah, yeah.

216
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,950
嘿
Hey.

217
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,150
呃 抱歉
Uh, sorry.

218
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,050
我最近睡得不好 所以...
I haven't been sleeping well, so...

219
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,390
哦
Oh.

220
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,150
嘿 那是洛奇的衬衫吗？
Hey, is that Rocky's shirt?

221
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,890
哦 是啊 是啊 你怎么知道的？
Oh, yeah, yeah. How'd you know?

222
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,730
- 你穿起来很好看 - 谢谢

223
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,860
呃 我们在寻找什么？
What, uh, what are we looking for?

224
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,970
哦 只是随便看看 我选书都是看封面的
Oh, just browsing. I pick books based on the cover.

225
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,230
我认为你不应该这么做
I thought you weren't supposed to do that.

226
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,800
你也不该把棉签塞进耳朵里
You're also not supposed to put Q-tips in your ear,

227
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,410
但如果你做得对 感觉就会非常好
but if you do it right, it feels really good.

228
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,970
我不知道我为什么要这么做
I don't know why I'm doing this

229
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,470
因为没人会听到它
'cause nobody's ever gonna hear it.

230
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,240
我曾经接过一个陌生号码的电话
I answered a call from an unknown number once,

231
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:10,380
他说 “嘿 我在想你 ”
and he said, "Hey, I was thinking about you."

232
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,780
“你今晚要做什么？”
"What are you doing tonight?"

233
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,580
我们烤了……
And we baked...

234
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,780
嘿
Hey.

235
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,150
我想我会留下来
Think I'm gonna stay.

236
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,460
- 什么？ - 是啊 律师说
- What? - Yeah. Lawyer says,

237
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,790
无论如何 遗嘱认证都需要一些时间
the probate's gonna take a little while anyway.

238
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,060
此外 Rocky 的老板还给我提供了一份工作
Plus, Rocky's boss offered me a job.

239
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:29,460
呃 他哭了很多 但我认为他是认真的
Uh, he was crying a lot, but I think he was serious.

240
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,570
唔
Hmm.

241
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:34,100
感觉我现在就需要待在这里
Feel like I need to be here right now.

242
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,970
完全
Totally.

243
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,070
是的
Yeah.

244
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,410
所以 我想这意味着你和我可以成为买菜的好朋友了
So, I guess that means you and I get to be grocery buddies.

245
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,080
嘿 你的语音信箱问候语怎么了？
Hey, what's up with your voicemail greeting,

246
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,450
顺便一提？

00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,650
再来一个
One more.

248
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,620

你相信死刑吗？
Do you believe in the death penalty?

00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,150
这就是你所想的吗？
That's what you were thinking about?

257
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,860
我想不会 因为有可能
I guess no. Because there's a chance

258
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:33,090
处决无辜者 并且死亡是不可挽回的
of executing someone innocent, and death is irrevocable.

259
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:37,460
是的 但有些事情是无法挽回的

260
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,670
真的
True.

261
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,840
你做过的最糟糕的事情是什么？
What's the worst thing you've ever done?

262
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,150
你做过的最糟糕的事情是什么？
What's the worst thing you've ever done?

263
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,280
有几个
There's a few.

264
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,390
毫米
Mm.

265
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,460
就这一次...
This one time...

266
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,070
罗基和我 呃……
Rocky and I, uh...

267
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,240
我们当时16岁
we were 16.

268
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,070
还有 嗯...
And, um...

269
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,410
他的死都是我的错
It was my fault he died.

270
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,650
- 什么？- 这是我的错
- What? - It was my fault.

271
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:34,490
迪恩应该去机场接我
Dean was supposed to pick me up from the airport.

272
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,690
但他忘了
But he forgot.

273
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:41,190
我本来可以叫辆出租车
And I could've just called a cab,

274
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,400
但我希望他能来接我
but I wanted him to pick me up,

275
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,830
所以我一次又一次地给他打电话
so I called him again and again and again,

276
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:48,740
而我却毫不留情
and I was relentless.

277
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,040
因此 他超速了
So, he broke the speed limit.

278
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,540
你可以猜到这是怎么回事
And you can guess where this is going.

279
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,780
他撞车了
He crashed.

280
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,710
我对他说的最后一句话是……
My last words to him were...

281
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,780
“去你的 ”
"Fuck you."

282
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,950
所以...这就是我的故事
So... that's my story.

283
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:07,690
一...
Um...

284
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:13,530
五年级的时候 我的左眼长了麦粒肿
In fifth grade, I had a stye in my left eye.

285
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:17,430
在学校拍照日 那是……
On school picture day. It was...

286
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,100
又肿又红
swollen and red.

287
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,940
我看起来像福里斯特·惠特克
And I looked like Forest Whitaker.

288
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,740
所以 我恳求待在家里
So, I begged to stay home.

289
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,080
但我被否决了
But I was overruled,

290
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:33,280
所以 Dean 在年鉴里假扮了我
so Dean pretended to be me for the yearbook.

291
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,750
他救了我 嗯……
He saved me. Um...

292
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,560
每当遇到困难时 他总会在我身边
He was always there on the bad days.

293
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,560
当街上的阿什利 呃
When Ashley from down the street, uh,

294
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,760
他取笑我的粉色铅笔盒 称她为黄油巨魔
made fun of my pink pencil box, he called her a butter troll.

295
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:53,970
呃 当我的继父让我不要再回家时
Uh, when my stepfather asked me not to come home anymore,

296
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,470
迪恩握住我的手
Dean held my hand.

297
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,780
感觉就像 呃...
Feels like, uh...

298
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,850
现在每天都是糟糕的一天
every day's a bad day now.

299
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,420
嗯 对不起 呃……
Um, sorry, uh...

300
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,860
好疼 嗯 真的好疼
It hurts. Like, um, it's literally painful.

301
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,190
但我喜欢它 因为
But I like it because

302

- 关于奶昔的事  - 哦 天哪

345
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,550
- 你是个该死的骗子  - 你为什么说日语？
- You're a skinny fucking liar. - Why do you speak Japanese?

346
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,490
因为我住在东京 你为什么要骗我？
Because I lived in Tokyo. Why would you lie to me?

347

噢 你喜欢跟着我吗？

- 你有多高？ - 五英尺十英寸

嗯 我身高五尺十寸 双胞胎

376
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,370

383
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,960
那么 你们曾经换过位置吗？
So, did you ever switch places?

384
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,600
大二

“她想要的只是另一个百吉饼 ”

389
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,570
噢 天哪 我要来了

390
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,310
那么 你为什么对双胞胎如此痴迷呢？
So, why are you so obsessed with twins?

391
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,450
嗯 我不想告诉你
Mm. I don't want to tell you.

392
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,020
哦 无论如何你都会告诉我的 来吧
Oh, you're gonna tell me anyway. Come on.

393
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,480
真尴尬
It's embarrassing.

394
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,420
好吧 今晚你已经跨过了那道门槛……
Well, you've crossed that threshold tonight...

395
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,590
...多次
...multiple times.

396
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,130
呃 嗯……
Uh, um...

397
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:57,200
我构建了这个幻想 我的母亲带我
I constructed this fantasy that my mother took me

398
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,100
我的父亲带走了我的双胞胎兄弟
and my father took my twin,

399
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,840
他们从不想让我们见面
and they never wanted us to meet,

400
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,340
这就是为什么
and that's why

401
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,610
我从未被允许去日本探望他
I was never allowed to visit him in Japan.

402
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:07,680
你真的相信吗？
Did you really believe that?

403
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:10,510
嗯 也许吧
Mm, maybe.

404
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,950
我不知道 我想
I don't know. I wanted to.

405
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:16,350
他们说我们生来孤独
They say we're born alone,

406
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,790
我们孤独地活着 也孤独地死去
we live alone and we die alone,

407
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,060
但是...对于双胞胎来说 情况并非如此
but... for twins, that isn't true.

408
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,890
你有一个天生的最好的朋友
You have a built-in best friend.

409
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,360
不 双胞胎也会感到孤独
No, twins can get lonely too.

410
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,000
我感到无比孤独
I'm incredibly lonely.

411
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,540
嗯嗯 你这么说只是为了让我感觉好一点
Mm-mm. You're just saying that to make me feel better

412
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,670
- 关于我自己 - 我不是 我是认真的
- about myself. - I'm not. I mean it.

413
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:38,870
我是认真的
I mean it.

414
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,310
我非常擅长...
I'm very adept at...

415
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,520
与其他人分享我自己
sharing myself with other people.

416
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,020
但有时我会感到力不从心
But sometimes I can run empty.

417
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,390
因为...
Because...

418
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:59,730
我总是付出 却很少得到
I'm always giving and not so much receiving.

419
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,430
对于罗曼来说 这是五五开
With Roman, it's fifty-fifty.

420
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,670
嗯 确实如此 我的意思是 我们……
Well, it was. I mean, we...

421
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,870
我们现在已经不怎么说话了
we don't really talk that much anymore.

422
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,740
发生了什么？
What happened?

423
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,040
只是生活
Just life.

424
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:16,240
显然 在成长过程中 我们是形影不离的 但是……
Growing up, we were attached by the hip, obviously, but...

425
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:24,220
现在我们非常不同了
We're very different... now.

426
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,390
我认为那是...
And I think that's...

427
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,590
我认为这对他来说更难
I think it's harder for him.

428
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,460
有一张我们小时候的照片 照片上我们穿着
There's a photo of us as kids where we're wearing

429
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,570
这些配套的睡衣 直到今天
these matching pajamas, and to this day,

430
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,240
我无法告诉你照片中的我是哪一个
I could not tell you which one I am in the picture.

431
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,540
这太疯狂了
It's crazy.

432
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,070
我是“我们”
I was "We."

433
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,610
现在 我就是“我”
And now, I'm "I."

434
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,550
你想念他
You miss him.

435
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,580
非常
Very much.

436
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,890
他是我最喜欢的人
He's my favorite person.

437
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,490
他认为我是好双胞胎 但事实是他
He thinks I'm the good twin, but it's him.

438
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,460
当我们还很小的时候 我……
When we were really little, I...

439
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,330
有一次我上楼梯时摔断了大脚趾
I broke my big toe tripping up the stairs one time,

440
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:16,300
当天晚些时候
and later that same day,

441
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,670
罗曼回家后脚骨折了
Roman comes home and has a broken foot.

442
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:25,080
他不想让我独自承受痛苦
He didn't want me to be in pain by myself.

443
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,650
哦 天哪 太可爱了
Oh. Oh, my God, that's adorable.

444
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,420
他可能 就像 丢了一个保龄球
He probably, like, dropped a bowling ball

445
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,480
在上面或某物上
on it or something.

446
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,950
-天哪 -我知道
- My God. - I know.

447
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,760
我从来没有骨折过
I've never broken a bone.

448
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:42,360
哦 不 现在 它就要发生了
Oh, no. Now, it's gonna happen.

449
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,370
就像一个东西 你不能这么说
It's like a thing. You can't say that.

450
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,470
好的
Okay.

451
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,840
你应该给他打电话
You should call him.

452
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,540
是的 我应该
Yeah, I should.

453
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,110
你应该给他打电话 我会听的
You should call him and I'll listen.

454
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,380
噢 天哪
Oh, Jesus.

455
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,850
抱住你的河马
Hold your hippos.

456
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,680
不 我不能
No, I can't.

457
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,020
我必须修复你们破裂的双胞胎关系
I must amend your broken twinship.

458
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:08,190
我一生都在等待这一刻
My whole life has been waiting for this moment.

459
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,690
你真贴心
You're really sweet.

460
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,330
我认为你会是一个很好的双胞胎
I think you'd be a good twin.

461
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,990
我爱上你了
I'm falling in love with you.

462
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,360
我听到了
I heard that.

463
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:08,950
我喜欢 OM 的这种字体
I like this font for the OM.

464
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,220
呃 龙虾？你快要把我杀了
Ugh, lobster? You're killing me.

465
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,820
这对血汗工厂的工人来说是一种冒犯
That's offensive to sweatshop workers,

466
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,120
你不觉得吗？
don't you think?

467
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,360
嘿 我可以问你一个私人问题吗？
Hey, can I ask you a personal question?

468
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,960
我不太喜欢在工作中谈论我的个人生活
I don't really like to talk about my personal life at work.

469
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,130
嗯 这是关于我的个人生活
Well, it's about my personal life.

470
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,800
当然可以
Sure, that's fine.

471
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,440
我和一个男人度过了一个美妙的约会
So I had this amazing date with a guy,

472
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,400
我们都喜欢美味的三明治
and we both like really good sandwiches,

473
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,810
所以我周一给他发了短信 “晚餐吃三明治吗？”
so I texted him on Monday, "Sandwiches for dinner?"

474
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,080
“明天、星期三、星期四或星期五怎么样？”
"How's tomorrow or Wednesday or Thursday or Friday?"

475
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,650
他没有回应
And he didn't respond.

476
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,750
太糟糕了
That's too bad.

477
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,780
- 进入下一个  - 嗯 我还没说完
- Onto the next. - Well, I'm not done.

478
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,450
所以我在周二跟进了他的情况
So I followed up with him on Tuesday,

479
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,650
“实际上 星期四不行” 尽管我可以
"Actually, can't do Thursday," even though I could.

480
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:47,450
“明天怎么样 也就是星期三或星期五？”
"How's tomorrow, aka Wednesday or Friday?"

481
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,820
附言：你今天过得怎么样？”
PS, how was your day?"

482
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,590
什么也没有
And nothing.

483
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:52,560
您认为我应该等多久才能再次给他发短信？
How long do you think I should wait before I text him again?

484
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,600
别再给他发短信了
Never text him again.

485
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:57,100
他不喜欢你
He doesn't like you.

486
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,430
毫米
Mm.

487
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,070
你好 丹尼斯
Hi, Dennis.

488
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,900
- 嘿 玛西 - 你今天过得怎么样？
- Hey, Marcie. - How's your day going?

489
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,470
呃 好吧 我可以问你吗？
Ugh, well. Can I ask you

490
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:05,770
- 一个个人问题？ - 嗯
- a personal question? - Mm-hmm.

491
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,510
你能连续发多少条短信
How many consecutive texts can you send

492
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,280
在你不再尊重自己之前 你会对潜在的灵魂伴侣抱有怎样的态度？
to a potential soulmate before you stop respecting yourself?

493
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:11,780
- 我已经五点了  - 他还没回应吗？
- I'm at five. - And he hasn't responded?

494
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,750
没有 我们度过了有史以来最美好的约会
No. And we had the best date ever.

495
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,280
清醒八小时 睡眠四小时
Eight hours awake and four hours asleep.

496
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,850
我不明白 他是不是在敷衍我？
I don't understand. Is he blowing me off?

497
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,350
不 这太傻了 为什么有人会忽略你？
No, that's silly. Why would anyone ignore you?

498
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:20,690
你真是个好人
You're such a great guy.

499
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,160
也许他只是真的很忙
Maybe he's just really busy.

500
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,990
有时电话很忙的时候
Sometimes when the phones are really busy,

501
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:27,800
我忘记回复事情 直到几天后才回复
I forget to reply to things until days later.

502
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,530
我想有些人会忘记你对他们有多重要
I think some people forget how much you mean to them

503
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,000
直到他们看到你的脸 你知道吗？
until they see your face, you know?

504
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,670
仿佛眼不见 心不烦
Like out of sight, out of mind.

505
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,700
我有点想出现在他家门口
I kind of just wanna show up at his door,

506
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,170
就像卡罗尔·金的那首歌
like that Carole King song.

507
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,440
这很浪漫吧？
That's romantic, right?

508
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:40,540
或许吧 有可能 是的
Maybe. It could be. Yeah.

509
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,610
我的意思是 你比我更了解他
I mean, you know him better than I do,

510
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,940
所以我说 跟着你的直觉走吧
so I say go with your gut.

511
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,380
你说得太对了
You're so right.

512
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,280
我知道你就是我要问的人
I knew you were the person to ask.

513
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,220
接待
Reception.

514
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,020
你好？
Hello?

515
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:57,990
UPS
UPS.

516
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,860
哦好的
Oh, okay.

517
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,380
- 来吧 - 好的
- Come on. - Okay.

518
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:18,250
我跟不上这个戏了
I can't keep up with this drama.

519
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,820
- 真的吗？ - 是的
- Is it really? - Yeah.

520
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,190
你是认真的？
Are you serious?

521
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,330
耶稣基督
Jesus Christ.

522
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,890
我正在路過這裡！
I'm traversing here!

523
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,590
-我一直想这么说 -等等
- I've always wanted to say that. - Wait,

524
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:05,790
太性感了
that was so sexy.

525
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,100
罗基！
Rocky!

526
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:16,040
去你的！
Fuck you!

527
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,770
你认识那家伙吗？
Do you know that guy?

528
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,640
是的 给我两分钟
Yeah. Give me two minutes.

529
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,780

530
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,920

542

嘿 呃……
Hey, uh...

543
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,050
没人会听到这个 嗯……
Nobody's ever gonna hear this. Um...

544
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,350
我曾经接过一个陌生号码的电话
I answered a call from an unknown number once,

545
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,530
他说 “嘿 我在想你
and he said, "Hey, I was thinking about you.

546
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,060
你今晚要做什么？”
What are you doing tonight?"

547
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:23,400
我们还烤了一个草莓奶油蛋糕
And we baked a strawberry shortcake.

548
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,230
早上
And in the morning,

549
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,870
我去寻找另一片
I went looking for another slice.

550
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,740
我忘了这只是一个梦
I forgot it was just a dream.

551
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,050
我们不咬人
We don't bite.

552
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,990
哦 抱歉 我想我迷路了
Oh, sorry. I think I'm lost.

553
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,390
我明白
I understand.

554
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:23,090
只要你愿意 你就可以听
You can just listen if you want.

555
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,430
你的双胞胎兄弟叫什么名字？
What's your twin's name?

556
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,600
当我们还是孩子的时候 洛奇很怕黑
Rocky was scared of the dark when we were kids.

557
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,940
我们有双层床
We had bunk beds,

558
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:44,580
但我和他总是共用上铺
but me and him would always share the top bunk.

559
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:48,180
所以 怪物无法抓住他
So, the monsters couldn't get him.

560
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,660
后来有一天晚上 他说他不害怕
Then one night, he said that he wasn't afraid.

561
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:58,330
而我才是那个害怕的人
And that I was the one who was afraid.

562
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,830
真他妈让我生气
Fucking pissed me off.

563
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,430
呃……
Uh...

564
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,530
我们可能年纪太大了 不适合同床共枕了
We were probably too old to be sharing a bed

565
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,370
无论如何 在那时
at that point, anyway.

566
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:14,780
我不知道——我不知道我为什么要讲这个故事
I don't-- I don't know why I was telling that story.

567
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,390
- 嗨 丹尼斯！ - 哦 操我！
- Hi, Dennis! - Oh, fuck me!

568
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,060
噢 对不起 我不是故意吓你的
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.

569
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,420
我以为我是最后一个来这里的人
I thought I was the last one here.

570
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,990
你还在工作吗？
Are you still working?

571
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:07,860
不 我正在学习
No, I'm studying.

572
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,730
对于 LSAT
For the LSAT.

573
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,530
我不知道你想成为一名律师
I didn't know you wanted to be a lawyer.

574
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:14,600
太酷了！哇！
That's so cool! Wow!

575
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,840
好的 祝你晚安
Okay, well, have a good night.

576
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:23,710
好的！再见 丹尼斯 哦 祝你好运
Okay! Bye, Dennis. Oh, and good luck.

577
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,660
- 喂？- 嘿
- Hello? - Hey.

578
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:43,530
是羅曼
It's Roman.

579
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,570
嘿
Hey.

580
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:46,800
你想和我一起去买杂货吗？
You wanna get groceries with me?

581
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:51,040
是啊！我一直想去商店
Yeah! I've been, um, meaning to go to the store.

582
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:45,690
罗基！
Rocky!

583
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,860
哦 哇 你……
Oh. Wow. You...

584
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,630
抱歉 你一定是 Rocky 的兄弟吧？
Sorry, you must be Rocky's brother?

585
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:54,800
是的 是的
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

586
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,170
嗯 我对你的损失深感抱歉
Um, I'm so sorry for your loss.

587
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:59,970
谢谢 你当时在仪式现场吗？还是……
Thanks. Were you at the service or...

588
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:02,780
不 我去塔希提岛是为了工作
No, I was-- I was in Tahiti, for work.

589
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:06,510
呃 但是他去世的时候我在场
Uh, but I was-- I was there when he died.

590
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:08,320
噢 你就是那个人
Oh, you're that guy.

591
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:10,020
我们只是想买点冻酸奶
We were just trying to get some froyo,

592
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:13,890
然后这个疯子就开始对我们尖叫
and this crazy fucking lunatic, like, starts screaming at us.

593
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,590
于是 洛奇走上街头
And so, Rocky stepped into the street,

594
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,690
然后这辆车突然从天而降
and this car came out of, like, nowhere,

595
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:19,390
我听到了嘎吱嘎吱的声音
and I heard this crunching sound.

596
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:22,130
哇 嗯 你没必要听这些
Wow. Um, you don't need to hear all that.

597
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:25,300
抱歉 我正在更换治疗师
I'm sorry. I'm in the process of switching therapists.

你看到那个疯狂尖叫的家伙了吗？或者......
Did you get a look at the crazy screaming guy or...

599
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,470
说实话 我没法告诉你 事情发生得太快了
I couldn't tell you, honestly. It just-- It happened so fast.

600
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,340
呃 我没能仔细看清他
Uh, I didn't get a good look at him.

601
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,310
哦 我刚刚想了很多
Oh. I've just, uh, thought a lot about

602
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:41,050
如果我见到他我会对他做什么
what I would do to that guy if I ever saw him.

603
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,890
把他的睾丸从喉咙里扯出来
Rip his fucking testicles right out of his throat,

604
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,220
把它们从他自己的阴茎洞里塞回去
shove them back down through his own dick hole,

605
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,620
退出他的屁股
back out his ass.

606
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,390
狠狠地打他的脸 直到他失去生命为止
Pummel his fucking face till he was past his expiration date.

607
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,100
嗨 抱歉 我没有——
Hi. I'm sorry. I didn't--

608
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,670
我不是故意打断你们的谈话
I didn't mean to interrupt your conversation,

609
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,570
但是 嗯...哦！
but, um... Oh!

610
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:04,840

613
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:11,850
但事实上 这种事经常发生在我身上
But it happens to me all the time, actually.

614
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:14,080
总是这样 我总是这么说
One of those faces. All the time. I always say that.

615
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,020
好的 嗯 一定是这样
Okay. Well, that must be,

616
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,220
那一定非常棒
that must be very nice.

617
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,690
不管怎样 我只是想说“嗨”
Anyway, I just wanted to say "Hi,"

618
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,190
嗯 抱歉 有点尴尬
and, um, sorry this was awkward,

619
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,020
但是 是的 我表示哀悼
but, yeah, my condolences.

620
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,960

祝你一切顺利
Have a good one.

622
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:30,970
那到底是什么？
What the hell was that?

623
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:33,470
我开始用不同的口音说话
I start talking in different accents

624
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,440
当我发现某人有吸引力时
when I find someone attractive.

625
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,310
这是一种防御机制
It's a defense mechanism.

626
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:39,440
等等 妈的
Wait, shit.

627
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:40,740
- 让我去把他带回来  - 不！

那么他是你喜欢的类型吗？
So was he your type?

629
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:45,950
呃……
Uh...

630
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,250
我觉得我没有那种类型
I don't think I have a type.

631
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:53,550
你知道吗 工作中有一个同性恋者
You know, there's a gay guy at work.

632
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:54,760
独自的
Sam.

633
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,990
你应该见见他 我觉得你们会相处得很好
You should meet him. I think you'd really get along.

634
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,390
你知道 这就像是 “你们都是亚洲人
You know, that's sort of like, "You're both Asian.

635
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,330
我确信你们有很多关于亚洲的事情要谈 ”
I'm sure you have lots of Asian things to talk about."

636
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,230
不 伙计 我只是想帮你牵线搭桥
No, man, I'm trying to hook you up.

637
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,900
快点
Come on.

638
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,440
你喜欢什么类型的女孩？
What kind of girls are you into?

639
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,940
我喜欢胸部
I like boobs.

640
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:17,610
但说实话 此时此刻 我只想认识一个好女孩
But honestly, at this point, I just wanna meet a nice girl.

641
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,680
好女孩没有胸部吗？
Nice girls don't have boobs?

642
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,780
如果你找到了 请告诉我
If you find one, let me know.

643
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,590
一起还是分开？
Together or separate?

644
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,190
- 一起  - 分开
- Together. - Separate.

645
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:33,960
这该死的灯为什么亮着？
Why is this fucking light on?

646
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,370
我的个人生活！
my personal life!

647
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,020
- 嗨 丹尼斯  - 嗯 嗨 玛西
- Hi, Dennis. - Mm, hi, Marcie.

648
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:57,720
- 你看起来真的很开心 - 嗯 谢谢

649
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:01,860
- 我很高兴 - 太棒了！真为你高兴

650
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:05,330

啊 太令人兴奋了 我喜欢冬季运动
Ah, how exciting. I love winter sports.

652
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:10,200
这是我内心的密歇根
It's the Michigan in me.

653
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,400
是的 对我来说有点睾丸激素味
Yeah, it's a bit testosterone-y for my taste,

654
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,670
但罗曼对此很感兴趣
but Roman's into it,

655
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,670
而人际关系则关乎妥协
and relationships are about compromise.

656
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,740
哦！罗曼是谁？
Ooh! Who's Roman?

657
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:19,240
他是你的男朋友吗？
Is he your boyfriend?

658
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,810
不 嗯 我们只是朋友
No. Um, we're just pals.

659
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,550
- 那真是太好了 - 是的
- That's really nice. - Yeah.

660
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:30,180
- 你结婚了吗？ - 我？
- Are you married? - Me?

661
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,920
不 嗯 你以为我结婚了吗？
No. Um, did you think I was married?

662
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:35,720
是的 你看起来就像某个人
Yeah, you just seem like someone

663
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,060
到你这个年纪就会结婚
who would be married by your age.

664
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,330
你这么说真有趣 因为所有的女人
It's funny you say that, because all the women

665
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,900
我家里的人结婚都很早
in my family married very young,

666
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:42,200
我一直认为
and I always thought

667
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:44,500
我会在28岁之前生一个孩子
I would have a kid before I turned 28.

668
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:46,570
当然 现在也有一些进步
And sure, these days, there are advancements,

669
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:49,340
但时间仍在流逝
but the clock is still ticking.

670
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:50,540
为了我的鸡蛋
For my eggs.

671
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:55,110
好的 好吧 我要去买更多的蛋糕
Right, well, I'm gonna get more cake.

672
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,910
好的 我就站在这里
Okay. I'll just stand here.

673
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:07,410
她问我是否想吃甜筒冰淇淋
So she asked if I want an ice cream cone,

674
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:09,920
我说：“好的 但是我想在里面放点冰淇淋 ”
and I said, "Yes, but I would like ice cream in it."

675
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:12,450
- 啊 - 什么？
- Ah. - What?

676
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:14,260
没什么 我的狗下巴让我很不舒服
Nothing. My dog jaw's bothering me.

677
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:15,490
- 你的狗下巴？ - 是的
- Your dog jaw? - Yeah.

678
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,320
- 你没听说过狗下巴吗？ - 没有
- You never heard of dog jaw? - No.

679
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,990
就像我生来就有下颌骨
It's like I was born with a jawbone

680
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:20,660
形状像爪印
that's shaped like a paw print.

681
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:21,930
- 什么？- 这里 是的 你就在这里能感觉到
- What? - Here. Yeah, you can feel it right here.

682
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,460
- 在这儿？ - 是的
- Here? - Yeah.

683
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,970
同性恋者
Faggots.

684
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,540

686
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:33,670
我说：“看看那些同性恋 ”
I said, "Look at those faggots."

687
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,780
你为什么不道歉？
Why don't you apologize?

688
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,480
嘿 你为什么不吮吸我的鸡巴？
Hey, why don't you suck my dick?

689
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,450
好吧 我会吮吸任何人的鸡巴
Okay, I will suck whosever dick

690
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,880
如果我们能够缓和局势
if we can just de-escalate the situation.

691
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:45,450
你应该听你女朋友的话
You should listen to your girlfriend.

692
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,120
说声对不起
Say you're sorry.

693
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,990

697
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:11,210

698
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:12,680
过来 你这个小混蛋
Come here, you little fucking piece

699
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:16,080
屎！
of shit!

700
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:17,720
羅馬
Roman.

701
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:19,350
羅馬 羅馬
Roman. Roman.

702
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:21,390
罗曼 罗曼 罗曼！停 停 停！
Roman, Roman, Roman! Stop, stop, stop!

703
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:24,890
噢 操！
Oh, fuck!

704
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:26,760
- 我们走吧 我们走吧 - 哦 操
- Let's go. Let's go. - Oh, fuck.

705
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,560
他妈的！
Fuck!

706
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:33,400
我以为 Z 世代应该是友善的
I thought Gen Z was supposed to be nice.

707
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:39,410
我把冰块放在桶里
I got ice in a bucket.

708
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:40,840
需要我把它放在你身上的任何地方吗？
Need me to put it anywhere on you?

709
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:43,340
是的 我的波本威士忌 我也给你倒了一杯
Yeah, my bourbon. I poured you one too.

710
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:51,720
好的
All right.

711
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:53,290
- 干杯 - 干杯
- Cheers. - Cheers.

712
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:01,760
好的
Okay.

713
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:07,700
那么 你从哪里学会打人呢？
So, where'd you learn to beat people up?

714
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:12,110
我小时候学过一点空手道
I took a little karate as a kid,

715
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,580
但当我没有获得蓝带时我就退出了
but I quit when I didn't make blue belt.

716
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,250
我想我高中毕业后尝试过一些综合格斗
Then I guess I dabbled in some MMA after high school,

717
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:20,750
但说实话 你不可能在课堂上学会打架
but honestly, you don't learn to fight in a classroom.

718
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,480
你在街头学习
You learn in the streets.

719
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:24,290
在街上？
In the streets?

720
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,490
你是谁？
Who are you?

721
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,120
那么 你没生气吗？
So, you're not mad?

722
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:32,090
以为你也许不会……
Thought maybe you wouldn't...

723
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:35,160
纵容暴力或类似的事情
condone violence or something.

724
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:37,060
这是自卫
It was self-defense.

725
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:40,130
上半场
For the first half.

726
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:44,970
好吧 如果你要下地狱 那就继续走吧
Well, if you're going to hell, keep going.

727
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:46,070
正确的？
Right?

728
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:50,180
正确的
Right.

729
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:54,980
嘿 我可以向你坦白一件事吗？
Hey, can I confess something to you?

730
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,790
我一直在使用 Rocky 的健身会员资格
I've been using Rocky's gym membership.

731
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,360
假装我是他
Pretending I'm him.

732
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,330
这有点糟糕 对吧？
It's kind of fucked up, right?

733
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,770
是啊 那是...
Yeah, that's...

734
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:14,540
疯狂的
crazy.

735
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,670
你知道吗 前几天我实际上在那里被袭击了
You know, I actually got hit on there the other day.

736
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,040
我想也许那家伙认识洛奇 所以 呃
I thought maybe the guy knew Rocky, so, uh,

737
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:23,610
我只是顺其自然
I just went with it.

738
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:25,650
他说了什么？
What did he say?

739
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:28,480
他说 “有人一直在锻炼手臂 ”
He was like, "Someone's been working their arms."

740
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:31,790
- 他没这么说 - 是啊 他说了 是啊 他……
- He did not say that. - Yeah, he did. Yeah, he...

741
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,150
然后我说 “是的
Then I said, uh, "Yeah,

742
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:36,160
你知道 我一直做得很好 ”
you know, I've been working 'em real good."

743
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:41,660
你真是个爱开玩笑的人
You're such a tease.

744
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,060
什么？我试验过了
What? I experimented.

745
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,030
- 你做到了？- 嗯
- You did? - Mm.

746
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:49,840
我 呃……
I, uh...

747
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:51,810
...曾经在聚会上亲吻过一个男人
...kissed a guy at a party once.

748
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:57,240
那是在洛奇 (Rocky) 出道之后
It was after Rocky came out.

749
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:59,380
我想我只是想了解一下
I think I was just trying to understand.

750
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:02,720
我从来没有告诉过他那件事
I never told him that.

751
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:14,190
你可以像跟洛奇一样跟我说话
You could talk to me like I'm Rocky.

752
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,570
是的 所以你现在已经死了
Yeah, so you're dead now.

753
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:27,710
这就是你不往两边看的后果
That's what you get for not looking both ways.

754
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,080
你只想向前看
You only wanna look forward.

755
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:34,950
抱歉 我甚至不知道该怎么做……
Sorry, I don't even know what to...

756
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:38,020
我甚至不记得上次
I can't even remember the last time

757
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:39,420
我们进行了一次真正的对话
we had a real conversation.

758
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:44,360
那不是“工作怎么样？”你知道的 “妈妈怎么样？”
That wasn't, "How's work?" You know, "How's Mom?"

759
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:49,300
而且它也总是按照你的时间进行
And it's always on your time too.

760
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,800
有更好的事情要做 对吧？
Better things to do, right?

761
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,100
第二天你就祝我“生日快乐”
You wished me a "happy birthday" the day after.

762
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:00,040
而且 我的意思是 我知道你没有忘记
And, I mean, I know you didn't forget.

763
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:02,940
就像 我——我很笨 但我还没有笨到那种程度
Like, I'm-I'm pretty stupid, but I'm not that fucking stupid.

764
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:08,550
你知道吗 我实际上一直等到午夜 以防万一
You know, I actually waited until midnight, just in case,

765
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,490
然后...然后第二个...
and... and the second it...

766
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:14,820
好吧 我突然发怒了 因为......
Well, I snapped, 'cause...

767
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,660
说实话 你真是太自私了
to be honest, you're so fucking selfish.

768
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:24,100
就像 什么 你不——你……你不想和我打交道？
Like, what, you don't-- you... you don't wanna deal with me?

769
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,970
你知道 我很抱歉我不读政治
You know, I'm-- I'm sorry I don't read politics,

770
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,910
或者......喜欢 或者其他什么 但是 喜欢......
or... ...like, or whatever, but, like...

771
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:36,910
你知道吗？
You know what?

772
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:39,910
我们之所以变成这样都是你的错
It's your fucking fault we're like this.

773
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,650
是的 你迫不及待地想离开 我的意思是 我会……
Yeah, you couldn't wait to get away. I mean, I would've,

774
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:45,620
我会跟随你去上大学
I would've followed you to college.

775
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,290
我本来会去日本 我就会弄清楚的
I would've gone to Japan. I would've figured it out.

776
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,320
但你根本就没问过我！
But you never even fucking asked me!

777
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:56,800
对不起
Sorry.

778
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,100
对不起！
I'm sorry!

779
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,170
抱歉 我无法控制自己的愤怒
I'm sorry I can't control my anger.

780
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:09,340
我很抱歉 当你告诉我你喜欢男人时 我对你大发雷霆
And I'm sorry I blew up at you when you told me you like guys.

781
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:14,880
对不起 我叫你同性恋
I'm sorry I called you a faggot.

782
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:19,490
我希望我能把它拿回来
I wish I could take it back.

783
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:22,890
哦 当我说这句话时你的表情
Oh, and your face when I said it,

784
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:25,030
我...
I...

785
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,660
我知道这就是你离开的原因！
I know that's why you left!

786
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:32,900
我想我只是——我害怕……
I think I was just-- I was scared that...

787
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,170
我不知道...我不知道
I don't... I don't know.

788
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,670
如果我没有……如果我没有……
If I didn't... if I didn't...

789
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,040
如果你不像我 我们不一样
If you weren't like me, and we weren't the same,

790
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:45,380
那样的话……我就不知道我是谁了 你知道吗？
then... then I wouldn't know who I was, you know?

791
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:47,310
但那——但没关系 因为你……
But that-- but that's okay, because you...

792
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:49,550
你可以谈论男人 我可以谈论女人
you can talk about guys, and I can talk about girls,

793
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,650
而我们仍然……
and we both still...

794
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:56,160
你知道 比如电子游戏、曲棍球和披萨
you know, like video games, and-and hockey, and pizza.

795
00:50:56,290 --> 00:50:58,490
嗯 每个人都喜欢披萨
Well, everybody likes pizza.

796
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:05,200
没有你我真不知道该怎么办
I don't know how to fucking be here without you.

797
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:12,770
没有你我真不知道该怎么办！
I don't know how to fucking be here without you!

798
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:18,450
没有你我真不知道该怎么办！
I don't know how to fucking be here without you!

799
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,730
我希望你能见到罗基
I wish you could've met Rocky.

800
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:43,240
他一定会非常喜欢你
He would've really liked you.

801
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,090
那里可能没有很多人
There might not be a lot of people there.

802
00:51:57,090 --> 00:51:57,220
分割线---------------------------------------

803
00:51:57,220 --> 00:52:00,150
先提醒你一下 嗯 玛茜她有点儿……
Just so you know, uh, Marcie's kind of a...

804
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:02,390
不是说她真是个废柴啦 不过
I mean, I don't wanna say she's a loser, but,

805
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,730
算了 你见了就明白
I mean, you'll see.

806
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:12,800
罗曼？
Roman?

807
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:15,840
哇哦 萨米 你怎么在这儿？
Whoa, Sammy. What are you doing here?

808
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:18,010
哦 我和玛茜一起上过木工课
Oh, I took a woodworking class with Marcie.

809
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:19,410
你怎么在这儿？
What are you doing here?

810
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:21,680
这是我朋友丹尼斯 他和玛茜一起工作
This is my buddy Dennis. He works with Marcie.

811
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,680
你好 我是萨米

你好
Hi.

813
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,580
他是我跟你说过的那个同性恋同事
He's the gay guy from work

814
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,020
我跟你提过的
I was telling you about.

815
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:30,690
有多大几率？
What are the odds?

816
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:32,320
你好 听说我们两同道中人
Hi. I hear we have a lot in common.

817
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,090
是吗？
Do you?

818
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:35,590
我去拿几杯喝的
I'll go get us a couple of drinks.

819
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,690
你们先聊聊吧
Why don't, uh, you two mingle?

820
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:48,770

Um... - Oh, uh... Yeah.

823
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,780
我喜欢动手做东西

我的手很嫩的
I have soft hands.

825
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,650
- 不错 - 有人说过我这双手

826
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:07,320
十指不沾阳春水
- of somebody who's never worked a day in their life.

827
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:09,460
- 哇 - 我妈说的

828
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:12,060

831
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,200

是的
Yeah.

834
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:26,740
呃……
Um...

835
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:29,680
你平时还有别的爱好吗？
Any other hobbies?

836
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:34,310
徒步、滑雪、滑翔伞、攀岩、山地滑板、

837
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:36,920
激流漂流 跑酷
White water rafting. Parkour.

838
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:39,220
爱好是不是有点多？
Feel like that's too many.

839
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:40,690
算个小毛病吧
It's a bit of a problem.

840
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:43,190
我算是个肾上腺素上瘾的人
I'm sort of an adrena-junkie, you know?

841
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:45,160
跑酷不是挺危险吗？
Isn't parkour dangerous?

842
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:47,360
- 不 - 但也有人丢了命吧？
- No. - But people die doing it?

843
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,000
对
Yes.

844
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:51,700
好吧
Okay.

845
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:54,000
关键是知道自己的极限
You just have to know your limits.

846
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:56,940
我对我的极限一无所知！
I don't know my limits!

847
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,240
比如 今年你干过最疯狂的事？
Like, what's the wildest thing you did this year?

848
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,880
一时想不起来 嗯……
Nothing comes to mind. Um...

849
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:06,680
陪审团 不过——
Jury duty. Or I almost--

850
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:09,250
有利益冲突 所以没被选上
I had a conflict, so they didn't pick me.

851
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:14,590
你挺可爱的
You're cute.

852
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:21,960
哦 你竟然从没玩过最早的《模拟人生》？
Oh, you never played the original Sims?

853
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,630
天啊 那可是最好玩的游戏
Oh, man, it's the best.

854
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:25,600
其实 很多人不知道它还挺难
Actually, a lot of people don't realize it was really hard.

855
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:27,140
因为没有周末
'Cause you don't get weekends,

856
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:28,940
所以整天都得上班
so you have to spend all your time going to work,

857
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:31,140
睡觉 洗澡 打扫 做饭
going to sleep, showering, cleaning, cooking,

858
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:33,710
拉屎 你懂吧
pooping, you know? Sorry.

859
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,810
你真的得照顾他们的需求
But, yeah, you really have to tend to their needs,

860
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,950
因为 他们会立马给你脸色看
'cause, um, they'll let you know about it.

861
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,450
他们会变得很暴躁
They get very cranky.

862
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:42,420
甚至会尿裤子
Um, they'll pee their pants.

863
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:45,990
还会陷入严重的抑郁
They'll, uh, get very depressed, actually.

864
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,290
对 真的会抑郁
They can get depressed.

865
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:49,260
哦 哇 我……
Oh. Wow. I...

866
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,760
我还一直以为只是个无聊游戏
I always just thought it was a silly game

867
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:54,100
- 里面人说着乱七八糟的语言  - 不不不
where they talk gibberish.No, no, no.

868
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:57,400
这可不是闹着玩的 就跟拼命似的
There's stakes. Yeah. It's life or death out there.

869
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:59,800
[模拟语：游戏《模拟人生》里的人物虚拟语言]
而且那不是瞎说话 是模拟语
And it's actually not gibberish. It's Simlish.

870
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:02,340
就像一门独立的语言
It's like it's whole own language.

871
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:05,340
咕吉嘎嘿 啊赖哩咯【模拟语】
gugi gahe a lie lilo bahao bahao wa... [Simlish]

872
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:11,510
对不起
Sorry.

873
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:13,250
太蠢了
Sorry. That's dumb.

874
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,420
不 挺可爱的
No, it's really sweet.

875
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:18,690
这是我小时候最喜欢的游戏
It was just my favorite game when I was a kid.

876
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,160
我有个双胞胎哥哥
I have a twin brother.

877
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:24,160
我们玩的入迷 常常一玩
We were obsessed with it, so we just would play it

878
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:25,790
就是好几个小时
for hours together.

879
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:29,530
现实里的时间 不是游戏里的那种
Real hours, not Sims hours. Yeah.

880
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,500
我总觉得 长大以后生活也会是那样
Part of me always thought that's what my life would be like

881
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:33,030
就像我们小时候一直玩的那样
when we got older too.

882
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:34,430
我和罗基会有一栋自己的房子
Rocky and I would get a house

883
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:36,370
在院子里打篮球
and shoot hoops on the SuperDoop,

884
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,040
泡在热水浴缸里聊天
talk in the hot tub.

885
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:39,770
我一直觉得自己会是那个留在家里的人
I was always the stay at home twin.

886
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:42,010
他会去上班 升职加薪
He'd get the job, the promotion,

887
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:45,510
而我就收拾屋子 修修东西
and I'd kind of clean the house, and, you know, fix things,

888
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:47,980
做点饭 然后……
and cook the meals, and...

889
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:50,820
结果总会把厨房点着
I'd always burn down the kitchen too.

890
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:52,720
他特别受不了这一点
Uh, he hated that.

891
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:55,290
你们现在还会一起玩吗？
Do you and Rocky still play?

892
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:57,530
不 他……
No, he, uh,

893
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:00,130
他其实几个月前就走了
he passed away a couple months ago, actually.

894
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:02,300
哦 不
Oh, no.

895
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:05,300
- 真对不起 - 没关系

896
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:08,200
嗯 反正你又不知道
Um, I mean, you didn't know.

897
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,310
我真的很难难过
I'm so sorry.

898
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:17,510
- 哦…… - 玛茜！万圣节快乐...
- Oh... - Marcie! Happy--

899
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:20,410
- 天哪 你还好吗？ - 我没事
- Oh, my God. Are you okay? - I'm fine.

900
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:23,380
我就是喝点酒容易矫情
I'm just an emotional drinker.

901
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,650
雪莉 万圣节快乐
Shelly, happy Halloween.

902
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:27,360
- 万圣节快乐！ - 你今晚美翻了
- Happy Halloween! - You look so great.

903
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:29,360
谢啦！
Thank you!

904
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:52,710
- 嘿 玛茜 - 嗨 丹尼斯
- Hey, Marcie. - Hi, Dennis.

905
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:54,880
- 派对很棒 - 谢谢你来玩
- Great party. - Yeah. Thanks for coming.

906
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:56,780
你朋友这么多 我真没想到
You have so many friends. Never would've guessed.

907
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,520
真的吗？嗯
Really? Huh.

908
00:56:58,650 --> 00:56:59,950
真有意思
That's interesting, yeah.

909
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:01,790
我是说 公司里的人都习惯刻板印象
I mean, everyone at work sees you a certain way,

910
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,490
但其实我是 ENFP 型人格
but I'm actually an ENFP personality.

911
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:05,860
我刚入职的第一周
Although my first week working here,

912
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:07,260
正好在恢复单核细胞增多症
I was getting over mono,

913
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,630
所以我都刻意保持距离
so I tried to avoid infecting anyone,

914
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,530
结果好像让人觉得我不好相处
and I think I made a bad impression.

915
00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:12,070
- 你怎么会得单核病？ - 我也说不上来
- How'd you get mono? - I don't know.

916
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,270
【卡帕·德尔塔：美国常见的大学姐妹会】
不过我大学时当过宿管 后来还混过卡帕·德尔塔
But I was an RA in college, and then Kappa Delta,

917
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,870
所以和十几个女生共用一个浴室根本无所谓
so I have no problem sharing a shower with ten other girls.

918
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:19,240
所以你才得的单核病？
That's how you got mono?

919
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:20,470
不是
No.

920
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,940
我的意思是 我一直都特别外向
I'm just saying I've always been an extrovert.

921
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,050
我就是喜欢跟人待在一起
I just love people.

922
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:25,490
不好意思
Oh.

923
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:27,750
前台接待
Reception.

924
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:28,980
让我帮您转接
Let me transfer you.

925
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:33,250
抱歉 我刚才一直在絮叨 你找我有事吗？
I'm sorry, you got me babbling. Um, did you need something?

926
00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:35,220
你还记得我的朋友罗曼吗？
Do you remember my friend Roman?

927
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,960
哦天啊 当然记得 他真是……
Oh, my gosh, yes. He is so...

928
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,130
嗯 我真的挺喜欢他的
Um, I really liked him.

929
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:41,430
嗯 我们在想
Well, we were thinking

930
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:43,260
要不要哪天一起出来玩
it might be fun to hang out sometime.

931
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,270
就是 像四个人一起的那种约会
Together. Like a double date.

932
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:48,270
罗曼就是分给我的那个对象？
And Roman would be my designated date?

933
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:50,440
对啊 这还不明显吗？
Yes. Was that not clear?

934
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:54,110
- 天啊！ - 呃……好啊！
- Oh, my gosh! - Um... ...yes!

935
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,240
我去定了
I'm so there.

936
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:58,080
哦 嘿 萨米 你好吗？
Oh, hey, Sammy. How you doing?

937
00:57:58,210 --> 00:58:01,020
- 嘿 发生什么事了？ - 没什么 没什么

这个周末遇见你真是太好了
It was cool running into you this weekend.

939
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:08,990
呃 嘿 你觉得我的朋友丹尼斯怎么样？
Uh, hey, what'd you think of my friend Dennis?

940
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:12,360
- 没有 - 好的
- No. - Okay.

941
00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:19,630
- 他在这里做什么？ - 我又碰到他了
- What is he doing here? - I ran into him again.

942
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:20,940
你告诉我你认为他很有魅力
You told me you thought he was attractive.

943
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:22,270
萨米怎么了？萨米很棒
What happened to Sammy? Sammy was great.

944
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,540
Sammy 说他觉得你很可爱
Sammy said that he thought you were cute,

945
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:24,770
但他并不可爱
but that he doesn't do cute.

946
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:26,440
- 我做不到！ - 是的 你可以
- I can't do this! - Yes, you can.

947
00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:27,980
我解释了一切
I explained everything.

948
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:30,280
他知道你实际上不是来自伦敦
He knows you're not really from London.

949
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:38,290
我对贝类过敏
I'm allergic to shellfish,

950
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:40,690
我曾经从滑雪缆车上摔下来过……
I once fell off a ski lift...

951
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:43,160
...嗯 我从来没有
...um, and I've never been

952
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:45,790
- 去另一个国家 - 没有人从滑雪缆车上掉下来
- to another country. - Nobody falls off a ski lift.

953
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:47,660
每个人都去过另一个国家
Everybody's been to another country.

954
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:50,000
- 我去过加拿大一次  - 好的
- I've been to Canada one time. - Okay.

955
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:52,230
哦天哪 好吧 你懂我意思了
Oh, gosh. Okay, you got me.

956
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:55,140
等一下 嗯 那你是怎么从滑雪缆车上摔下来的？
Wait. Um, so how did you fall off a ski lift?

957
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:56,840
呃 我们小时候 我们进行了一次圣诞旅行
Uh, we were kids, we took a Christmas trip

958
00:58:56,970 --> 00:58:59,740
有一次去太阳谷 洛奇掉了手套
to Sun Valley once, and Rocky dropped his glove,

959
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:01,810
我伸手去抓它
and I reached for it and tried to grab it.

960
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:03,140

头先出来 十、十五英尺
Head first, ten, 15 feet.

00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:08,350
呃 我记得刚刚听到手腕上传来一声脆响
Uh, I remember just hearing this snap in my wrist.

963
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,150
- 天啊 - 是啊

967
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:16,860
- 你甚至没有口音  - 好吧 轮到我了
- You don't even have an accent. - Okay, my turn.

968
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:20,060
我不会吹口哨 我曾经把我的猫面条换了
I can't whistle, I once traded my cat Noodles

969
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:22,760
送给我邻居的戴安娜王妃豆豆娃
for my neighbor's Princess Diana Beanie Baby.

970
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:24,330
数小时后 该交易被撤销
The deal was revoked hours later.

971
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:27,470
还有什么？还有什么？嗯 哦
And what else, what else? Um, oh.

972
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,400
我参加了《真实世界》的试镜……
I auditioned for The Real World...

973
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:32,270
...我上大学的时候在圣地亚哥
...San Diego when I was in college.

974
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:35,880
嗯 你的第二个问题太具体了 不可能是谎言
Mm, your second one is too specific to be a lie.

975
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,710
你也没有参加《真实世界》的试镜
And you didn't audition for Real World.

是的 你在最后一个之前犹豫了

981
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,090
是的 诀窍就是说点什么
Yeah. Well, the trick is to say something

982
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:56,530
从情感上来说这是正确的 但从事实上来说却是错误的
that is emotionally true but factually false.

983
00:59:58,270 --> 01:00:00,540
- 是啊 - 好的 嗯 轮到我了
- Yeah. - Okay, um, my turn.

01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:05,570
我在一次跳水事故中差点失去了一个睾丸……
I almost lost a testicle in a diving board accident...

986
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:21,760
你知道 我曾经感觉...
You know, I used to feel...

987
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:29,300
我不想说单身人士“优越” 但是......
I don't wanna say "superior" to singletons, but...

988
01:00:32,370 --> 01:00:33,900
是的 我为他们感到难过
Yeah, like, I felt bad for them.

989
01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:37,510
现在 我和其他人一样
And now, I'm just like everybody else.

990
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,440
除了更糟的情况
Except worse.

991
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:42,840
因为我知道
Because I know.

992
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:48,780
无论我走到哪里 都能看到双胞胎
I see twins everywhere I go.

993
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:51,250
我的酒吧 我的公园
My bar, my park.

994
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:53,490
我不得不换果汁店
I had to switch juiceries,

995
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:56,290
因为我雇佣了双胞胎收银员
because my go-to hired twin cashiers.

996
01:00:56,790 --> 01:00:57,890
- 嗨 孩子们 - 嘿
- Hi, boys. - Hey.

997
01:00:58,030 --> 01:00:59,360
- 早上好 - 早上好
- And good morning. - Morning.

998
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:00,960
我偷偷地通过了安检
I snuck it past security.

999
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:03,800
- 天哪 你太淘气了  - 不 我没有
- My God, you're so naughty. - No, I didn't.

1000
01:01:03,930 --> 01:01:05,930
- 我只是很有礼貌地问一下  - 哦
- I just asked really politely. - Oh.

1001
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:07,470
我本来想给你买一个 但罗曼说
I would've brought you one, but Roman says

1002
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:08,840
你不喝咖啡
you don't drink coffee.

1003
01:01:08,970 --> 01:01:10,970
是的 咖啡对牙齿不好 我喝茶
Yeah, coffee's bad for your teeth. I drink tea.

1004
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:14,380
你知道 茶实际上含有
You know, tea actually contains

1005
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:16,010
单宁含量比咖啡高
a higher tannin content than coffee,

1006
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:18,110
所以它更容易弄脏你的牙齿
so it's more likely to stain your teeth.

1007
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:19,680
- 有趣的事实！ - 我不知道
- Interesting fact! - I didn't know that.

1008
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:22,650
- 是的 - 仅供参考 星巴克卖茶
- Yeah. - Starbucks sells tea, FYI.

1009
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:24,150
哦 我自己煮咖啡
Oh, I brew my own coffee.

1010
01:01:24,290 --> 01:01:26,320
我真的很喜欢他们的旅行杯
I just really like their travel mugs.

1011
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:31,630
- 你今天看起来真可爱 - 谢谢 宝贝

1012
01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:01,760
哦 丹尼斯
Oh, Dennis.

1013
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:03,360
我昨天在健身房看到一对双胞胎
I saw a pair of twins at the gym yesterday,

1014
01:02:03,490 --> 01:02:06,030
然后我在回家的路上又看到了另一对双胞胎
and then I saw another pair of twins on my walk home.

1015
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,930
就好像它们无处不在一样
It's like they're everywhere.

1016
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:10,200
- 这就是频率错觉 - 什么？
- That's the frequency illusion. - What?

1017
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:12,600
又称巴德尔-迈因霍夫现象
Also known as the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon.

1018
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:14,670
就像我得到我的海军蓝普锐斯时一样
It's like when I got my navy blue Prius.

1019
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,000
突然间 我到处都能看到深蓝色的普锐斯
Suddenly, I was seeing navy blue Prii everywhere,

1020
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:19,270
但它们一直都在那里 只是我没有注意到
but they'd always been there, I just wasn't paying attention.

1021
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:22,080
你今天真聪明 我的意思是 你每天都很聪明
You are so smart today. I mean, you're smart every day,

1022
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:23,680
- 但尤其是今天 - 不！
- but especially today. - No!

1023
01:02:23,810 --> 01:02:25,110
我主修心理学
I was a psychology major.

1024
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:27,180
这就是你担任接待员的原因
That's why you're a receptionist.

1025
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:28,620
因为你很善于与人相处
'Cause you're so good with people.

1026
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:30,920
谢谢 丹尼斯
Thanks, Dennis.

1027
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:34,220
不管怎样 它让我想起了我们在小组里的讨论
Anyway, it, uh, reminded me of the discussion we had in group.

1028
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:36,120
什么群？
What group?

1029
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:38,060
我一直在谈论的支持小组
The support group I'm always talking about.

1030
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:41,030
等等 丹尼斯有双胞胎吗？
Wait, does Dennis have a twin?

1031
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:44,060
是的 我们就是这样认识的 我好像跟你说过
Yeah, that's how we met. I thought I told you this.

1032
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,270
不 我……
No, I...

1033
01:02:45,870 --> 01:02:47,540
丹尼斯 你告诉我你是独生子
Dennis, you told me you were an only child.

1034
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:49,300
- 嗯 我没告诉你 - 是啊 是啊！
- Mm, I didn't tell you that. - Yeah, yeah!

1035
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,740
星期五是百吉饼日
It was bagel Friday.

1036
01:02:50,870 --> 01:02:52,710
我记得 因为我也是独生子
I remember, because I'm an only child too,

1037
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,410
而且我们都是狮子座
and-and we're both Leos.

1038
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:57,280
嗯 我现在是独生子
Well, I am an only child now,

1039
01:02:57,410 --> 01:02:59,880
因为我的双胞胎兄弟迪恩去世了 这对我而言非常私人
because my twin, Dean, died, and it's very personal,

1040
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:02,220
所以我想我不太愿意告诉你这件事
so I guess I didn't feel comfortable telling you that.

1041
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:04,450
- 非常抱歉  - 没关系
- I'm so sorry. - It's fine.

1042
01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:07,760
没关系
It's okay.

1043
01:03:07,890 --> 01:03:09,890
你知道吗 我感觉自己像个傻瓜
You know, I feel like such a doofus,

1044
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:11,730
因为有一次在工作中
because there was that one time at work

1045
01:03:11,890 --> 01:03:14,230
几个月前 我不想打探
a couple of months ago, and I didn't want to pry,

1046
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:15,800
但你却如此悲伤
but you were so sad,

1047
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:18,470
而且你有点难以理解
and-and you were kind of hard to understand,

1048
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:19,930
但你刚才说的是
but you were saying something about

1049
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:21,970
你一生的挚爱是如何被——
how the love of your life had been hit by a--

1050
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:25,640
不！住手！
No! Stop!

1051
01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:27,240
- 丹尼斯？- 你还好吗 伙计？
- Dennis? - You okay, man?

1052
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:29,980
呃 我得离开这里！我有幽闭恐惧症
Uh, I-I need to get out of here! I'm-I'm claustrophobic,

1053
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:31,980
我不想谈论 Dean！
and I don't wanna talk about Dean!

1054
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:33,780
我认为他正处于焦虑症发作中
I think he's having an anxiety attack.

1055
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:36,520
是的！我焦虑症发作了！
Yes! I-I'm having an anxiety attack!

1056
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:40,520
焦虑症发作！焦虑症发作！
Anxiety attack! Anxiety attack!

1057
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,130
- 嘿 - 所以 我和经理莎伦谈过了——

1058
01:03:51,270 --> 01:03:52,700
噢 她真是个甜心
Oh, she's a sweetheart.

1059
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:54,300
我们想要信用还是退款？
Do we want credit or a refund?

1060
01:03:55,070 --> 01:03:56,270
- 退款 - 信用
- Refund. - Credit.

1061
01:03:59,770 --> 01:04:01,040
乔尼死了
Jonny died.

1062
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:03,340
我的狗
My dog.

1063
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:07,110
我不应该用我哥哥的名字给他命名
I shouldn't have named him after my brother.

1064
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:10,320
就好像他又重新经历了一切
It's like he's gone all over again.

1065
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:16,060
乔尼死后 真正的乔尼
After... Jonny died, the real Jonny,

1066
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:18,460
我开始对我的妻子产生依赖
I became glued to my wife.

1067
01:04:19,930 --> 01:04:22,730
她说我想取代我的兄弟……
She said I was trying to replace my brother...

1068
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:46,420
- 丹尼斯 - 也许你应该得到它
- Dennis. - Maybe you should get it.

1069
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:48,590
已经是第三次了 可能是紧急情况！
It's the third time. It could be an emergency!

1070
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:52,060
哦天哪 糟了
Oh, my God. Shit.

1071
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:57,770
嘿 哥们 很晚了 还好吗？

So, what's up?

1077
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:11,450
只是想看看你在做什么
Just wanted to see what you were doing.

1078
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:14,180
呃 我们什么都没做 只是谈论圣诞节
Uh, we're doing nothing, talking about Christmas

1079
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:18,190
还有长袜和所有我们想塞进去的东西
and stockings and all the stuff we want to stuff in them.

1080
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:20,090

我确信我会找到一些事情做
I'm sure I'll find something to do.

我喜欢看的未读书籍集
unread collection of books I like to look at.

1087
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,210
丹尼斯 等一下 我让你等一下

嘿 伙计 抱歉这么久才回复 嗯
Hey, buddy, sorry that took so long. Um,

- 你连一棵树都没有吗？ - 不 我没有得到一棵树
- Did you not even get a tree? - No, I didn't get a tree.

1100
01:06:22,450 --> 01:06:24,520
我们为什么不打电话给那个该死的管家呢？
Why don't we call the fucking butler?

节日到了！为什么不买棵树呢？
It's the holiday! Why wouldn't you get a tree?

1102
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:29,160
别从我做起 求你了 别从我做起
Don't start with me. Please, don't start with me.

1103
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:30,830
没关系 你为什么不带棵树呢？
It's fine. Why didn't you bring a tree?

1104
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,960
- 我应该拖一棵树吗？ - 这是谁的工作？
- I'm supposed to lug a tree? - Whose job is it?

1105
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:34,630
- 不！- 这太自私了！没错！
- No! - It's selfish! Yes, it is!

1106
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,870
别这样对我！你怎么能这样对我？
Don't say that to me! How can you say that to me?

1107
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,670
因为这根本就是事实！
Because it's the fucking truth!

1108
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,770
这不是他想要的！这他妈的根本不是他想要的！
It's not what he wanted! It's not fucking what he wanted!

1109
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:42,800
你不知道这一点 你并非无所不知
You don't know that. You don't know everything.

你认为我太刻薄了吗？
Do you think I was being too mean?

1116

1122
01:07:20,610 --> 01:07:21,680

Because it gets better.

1123

It's a Winston Churchill quote.

1124

他懒得把他的东西带走

他们说没有什么比失去孩子更糟糕的了

Roman 提到 Dean 去世了
Roman mentioned that Dean passed away,

1206
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:10,590
大概一年半前 这毫无意义
like, a year and a half ago, and that didn't make sense

1207
01:13:10,730 --> 01:13:13,360
因为我大约一年半前就认识你了 我应该知道这一点
because I knew you, like, a year and a half ago, and I should've known that.

1208
01:13:13,490 --> 01:13:15,700
你在 Instagram 上没有他的照片
And you don't have photos of him on Instagram,

1209

我想 “嗯 这很奇怪

我看到你和谁一起上高中

我在油画课上认识了他
I met him in an oil painting class,

1216
01:13:31,910 --> 01:13:33,610
他说你没有兄弟
and he said you didn't have a brother

1217
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:36,720
他百分之百确定 因为你每天午餐都独自坐着
and he's 100 percent sure because you sat alone at lunch every day

1218
01:13:36,850 --> 01:13:38,390
他妈妈让他去参加你的生日聚会
and his mom made him go to your birthday party

1219
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,290
没有其他人出现 你有一张单人床
and no one else showed up and you have a twin bed,

1220
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:42,460
但只有一个 而且他还让它听起来像
but just one, and he also made it sound like

1221
01:13:42,590 --> 01:13:44,090
你胡闹了 但我不确定
you fooled around in it, but I couldn't be sure

1222
01:13:44,230 --> 01:13:45,390
因为我听到他妻子在后面说话——
'cause I heard his wife in the background--

1223
01:13:45,530 --> 01:13:46,660
你为什么要监视我？
Why are you spying on me?

1224

你认识罗曼的兄弟罗基吗？

1226

罗曼认为你们之所以相遇是因为你失去了一个双胞胎

根本不存在的双胞胎
A twin that doesn't even exist.

1229
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:03,410
你不能对他隐瞒这件事 丹尼斯
You can't keep this from him, Dennis.

1230
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:04,810
他必须知道真相
He has to know the truth.

1231
01:14:04,950 --> 01:14:06,750
当我准备好时我会告诉他
I will tell him when I'm ready.

1232
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:08,550
你现在就得告诉他 不然我就告诉他
You need to tell him now or I will.

1233
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,380
你不会告诉他的 玛西
You're not telling him, Marcie.

1234
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:11,920
我的意思是 上帝 你拥有一切

我很高兴 他也很高兴 我帮助他
I'm happy. He's happy. I help him.

1240
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:24,170
当他凌晨 3 点需要找人聊天时
When he needed somebody to talk to at 3:00

1241
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:25,830
早上 我接了电话
in the morning, I'm the one who picked up the phone.

1242
01:14:25,970 --> 01:14:27,400
你当时到底在哪儿啊？
Where the fuck were you then, huh?

1243
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:29,570
如果不是我 你甚至不会认识罗曼
You wouldn't even know Roman if it wasn't for me.

1244
01:14:32,970 --> 01:14:34,840
您希望我做什么？
What do you expect me to do?

1245
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:43,120
我知道我需要告诉他 我只是……
I know I need to tell him. I just...

1246
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:46,790
我想要多一点时间

她说她这个周末不能见我

01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:33,200
并说我应该和你谈谈
and said that I should talk to you.

1251
01:15:34,170 --> 01:15:36,470
我的意思是 你确定她什么都没说吗？

1252
01:15:38,170 --> 01:15:39,740
哦 你知道吗？我完全忘了
Oh, you know what? I totally forgot

01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:49,720
她为什么不直接告诉我呢？
Why wouldn't she just tell me that?

I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

1323
01:19:32,770 --> 01:19:35,080
我不知道按摩学校里有没有教这个
I don't know if they teach that, like, in-in massage school,

1324
01:19:35,210 --> 01:19:38,080
但我只是 呃 我不喜欢那样 所以……
but I'm just, uh, I'm not into that. So...

1325
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:41,750
抱歉 只是……
I'm sorry. It's just...

1326
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:44,420
你看上去很像他
You look so much like him.

1327
01:19:44,550 --> 01:19:45,750
像谁？
Like who?

1328
01:19:45,890 --> 01:19:47,920
哦 我不想让你恨我
Oh, I don't want you to hate me.

1329
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:49,760
我不恨你 这没什么大不了的 你知道吗？
I don't hate you. It's not a big deal, you know?

1330
01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:51,290
只是不要再这样做了
Just don't do it again.

1331
01:19:51,430 --> 01:19:54,300
是的 如果我告诉你 你会恨我的
Yeah, if I tell you, you're gonna hate me,

1332
01:19:54,430 --> 01:19:56,400
然后一切都会结束
and then it's gonna be over.

1333
01:19:56,530 --> 01:19:59,170
你在说什么？我……我为什么要恨你？
What are you talking about? Why... why would I hate you?

1334
01:20:01,570 --> 01:20:03,000
因为 嗯...
Because, um...

1335
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:06,680
我没有双胞胎 而且迪恩也不是真实存在的
I don't have a twin, and Dean isn't real.

1336
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:08,910
什么 -
Wha--

1337
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:12,680
你什么意思？他不是真的 是什么意思？
What do you mean? What do you mean he isn't real?

1338
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:16,520
我虚构了他 他根本不存在
I made him up. He doesn't exist.

1339
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:20,150
你到底在说什么？
What the fuck are you talking about?

1340
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:22,190
您为什么加入支持小组？
Why are you in the support group?

1341
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:24,830
我刚刚开始关注你
I just started following you.

1342
01:20:25,390 --> 01:20:28,360
我以为这是一个征兆 我一直试图告诉你
I thought it was a sign, and I kept trying to tell you,

1343
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,930
但是我——我的意思是 你怎么说……
but I-- I mean, how do you say...

1344
01:20:31,070 --> 01:20:32,830
哦 我爱上你的哥哥了
Oh, I was in love with your brother.

1345
01:20:32,970 --> 01:20:34,600
但那并不是真正的爱情 因为我只认识他
Except it wasn't really love because I only knew him

1346
01:20:34,740 --> 01:20:36,640
一天 但当时 感觉已经足够了 而且……
for a day, but at the time, that felt like enough, and...

1347
01:20:36,770 --> 01:20:39,510
我是那个在十字路口的疯狂家伙
And I was the crazy guy in-in the intersection,

1348
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:41,140
你知道 严格来说这不是我的错
and, you know, it wasn't technically my fault,

1349
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:42,780
但如果他从未遇见我 他可能还活着
but if he never met me, he'd probably still be alive,

1350
01:20:42,910 --> 01:20:44,950
那是我一生中最糟糕的一天 而且……
and it was the worst day of my life and...

1351
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:46,380
我不知道为什么我一直撒谎
I don't know why I kept lying.

1352
01:20:46,510 --> 01:20:48,450
我只是...我想靠近你
I just... I wanted to be close to you,

1353
01:20:48,580 --> 01:20:49,720
我认为我可以做得更好
and I thought I could make it better,

1354
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:51,050
但我只是让事情变得更糟
but I just kept making things worse.

1355
01:20:51,190 --> 01:20:52,690
而且 Marcie 并没有选择默默隐居
And-and Marcie isn't on a silent retreat,

1356
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:55,690
而且我...我没有上过按摩学校 但是...
and I... I didn't go to massage school, but...

1357
01:20:55,820 --> 01:20:58,490
你是我最好的朋友
You are my best friend.

1358
01:20:59,290 --> 01:21:02,500
我不希望这种情况发生改变
And I don't want that to change.

1359
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:08,640
我不知道该怎么办
I don't know what to do.

1360
01:21:11,110 --> 01:21:12,340
你恨我嗎？
Do you hate me?

1361
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:18,980
罗曼？请说点什么
Roman? Please say something.

1362
01:21:20,010 --> 01:21:24,550
罗曼 你恨我吗？
Roman. Do you hate me?

1363
01:21:26,190 --> 01:21:27,560
别他妈的碰我
Don't fucking touch me.

1364
01:21:27,690 --> 01:21:29,660
罗曼 求你了 我……我很抱歉
Roman, please. I... I'm sorry.

1365
01:21:29,790 --> 01:21:31,890
别他妈碰我！
Don't fucking touch me!

1366
01:22:14,740 --> 01:22:16,870
我只是不停地打他
I just kept hitting him.

1367
01:22:18,870 --> 01:22:20,140
停不下来
Couldn't stop.

1368
01:22:39,690 --> 01:22:41,860
嗨 丹尼斯 我是玛西
Hi, Dennis. It's Marcie.

1369
01:22:42,030 --> 01:22:45,300
你没上班 Sage 让我给你打电话
So you're not at work. Sage asked me to call you.

1370
01:22:45,430 --> 01:22:47,230
你今天会来吗？
Are you coming in today?

1371
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:49,870
瞧 罗曼非常沮丧
Look, Roman's pretty upset.

1372
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,570
他希望你不要再给他打电话
He wants you to stop calling him,

1373
01:22:51,740 --> 01:22:53,470
他也不想让我和你说话
and he doesn't want me talking to you either,

1374
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:55,310
但我会想着你
but I'll be thinking of you.

1375
01:23:02,450 --> 01:23:04,890
你看到什么了吗...我看到了什么？
Do you see what... I see?

1376
01:23:05,050 --> 01:23:09,120
我不知道你看到了什么 但我看到的就是我
I don't know what you see, but what I see is me.

1377
01:23:09,290 --> 01:23:10,420
我也看到我了
I see me too.

1378
01:23:10,590 --> 01:23:12,960
这是否意味着你们有两个人
Does that mean there's two of you

1379
01:23:13,130 --> 01:23:15,130
或者...或者我两个？
or... or two of me?

1380
01:23:19,670 --> 01:23:20,640
哦
Oh.

1381
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:24,740
哇
Wow.

1382
01:23:24,910 --> 01:23:27,010
我们确实有两个人
There really is two of us.

1383
01:23:27,140 --> 01:23:28,810
你不觉得这很奇怪吗？
Don't you find this odd?

1384
01:23:28,980 --> 01:23:31,180
不 这很奇怪
No, this is weird.

1385
01:23:31,350 --> 01:23:34,720
这真的非常非常奇怪
This is really, really weird.

1386
01:23:34,780 --> 01:23:38,090
等一下 你住在卡拉威家
Wait a sec. You live at the Callaway house.

1387
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:40,960
你就是那个来自营地的女孩
And you're that girl from camp.

1388
01:23:41,090 --> 01:23:43,460
他们以为我就是你！
They thought I was you!

1389
01:23:44,630 --> 01:23:46,830
那么今天谁想开始呢？
So who'd like to start today?

1390
01:23:54,430 --> 01:23:57,370
好吧 如果没有人说 那么我就说吧
Okay, if no one's gonna say it, then I'll say it.

1391
01:23:57,500 --> 01:24:01,040
Roman 给我们发了一封电子邮件 说你编造了 Dean
Roman sent us all an email that said you made Dean up,

1392
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:02,910
我觉得你就是个讨厌鬼
and I think that you're a fucking creep.

1393
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:05,350
这是真的吗 丹尼斯？
Is this true, Dennis?

1394
01:24:11,390 --> 01:24:14,050
真的吗？呃 我是说……
True? Uh, I mean...

1395
01:24:14,190 --> 01:24:16,820
从技术上来说...确实如此
Technically... it's true,

1396
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:19,830
但我一直感觉和你们所有人如此亲近
but I-I've always felt so connected to all of you,

1397
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:22,500
我一直想要一个双胞胎
and I've always wanted a twin.

1398
01:24:22,630 --> 01:24:25,270
有时 迪恩会感到真实
Sometimes Dean felt real.

1399
01:24:25,830 --> 01:24:27,670
他最喜欢的零食是热椒盐卷饼
His favorite snack is a hot pretzel

1400
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:29,270
加海盐和……
with sea salt and...

1401
01:24:29,970 --> 01:24:33,210
你知道 双胞胎身份可能只是一种构造
You know, maybe twin identity is really just a construct,

1402
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:35,880
比如性别
like gender.

1403
01:24:36,010 --> 01:24:39,710
哦 好吧 或者可能不是 嗯……
Oh, okay. Or it's maybe not. Um...

1404
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:45,750
我正在阅读有关消失的双胞胎综合症的文章
I was reading about vanishing twin syndrome.

1405
01:24:46,650 --> 01:24:48,060
因为我一直认为
Because I've always thought

1406
01:24:48,190 --> 01:24:51,030
有什么东西或某个人失踪了
there was something or someone missing.

1407
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:57,230
我妈妈肚子里可能还有一个双胞胎
And it's possible that I had a twin in my mother's womb,

1408
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:59,130
但我吃了他
but I ate him.

1409
01:24:59,930 --> 01:25:03,540
我想问她 但我不能 因为她已经死了
And I'd ask her, but I can't because she's dead.

1410
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,140
真的死了 她是真实存在的
Really dead. She's real.

1411
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:10,410
我们相信你有妈妈
We believe you got a mom.

1412
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:13,280
我不知道
I don't.

1413
01:25:48,620 --> 01:25:50,650
打扰一下 你能给我们拍张照吗？
Excuse me. Can you take a picture of us?

1414
01:25:52,390 --> 01:25:55,660
不 不 我不能 你不知道自己有多幸运
No. No, I can't. You have no idea how lucky you are.

1415
01:25:55,790 --> 01:25:57,830
嗯 很抱歉我们问了这个问题
Well, sorry we asked.

1416
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:10,470
他妈的
Fuck.

1417
01:26:14,110 --> 01:26:15,680
你要买什么？
What are you looking for?

1418
01:26:15,810 --> 01:26:18,310
我找不到洛奇的毛衣 呃……
I can't find Rocky's sweater. Uh...

1419
01:26:19,350 --> 01:26:21,720
有条纹的那个 那个……
The one with the-- with the stripes, the...

1420
01:26:21,850 --> 01:26:23,320
你把它移走了吗？你把它放到别处了吗？
Did you move it? Did you put it somewhere?

1421
01:26:23,450 --> 01:26:24,720
不 我没有碰它
No, I didn't touch it.

1422
01:26:25,990 --> 01:26:28,220
我敢打赌丹尼斯偷了它 那个假双胞胎
I bet Dennis stole it, that fake twin fucker.

1423
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:30,790
我确信它会出现
I'm sure it'll turn up.

1424
01:26:30,930 --> 01:26:32,360
是啊 你怎么知道的？
Yeah, how the fuck do you know that?

1425
01:26:37,130 --> 01:26:38,070
对不起
I'm sorry.

1426
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:39,170
你不能这样跟我说话
You can't talk to me like that.

1427
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:40,740
我知道 对不起
I know. I'm sorry.

1428
01:26:41,470 --> 01:26:43,240
对不起 对不起
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1429
01:26:46,970 --> 01:26:48,180
我原谅你
I forgive you.

1430
01:26:51,150 --> 01:26:52,550
我不值得
I don't deserve it.

1431
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:57,480
应得的惩罚并不是获得宽恕的必要条件
Deservedness is not a requisite for forgiveness.

1432
01:27:03,460 --> 01:27:05,560
我帮你看看
I'll help you look.

1433
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:46,200
- 现在不行 - 什么时候？
- Not right now. - When?

1434
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:51,240
- 再过三十分钟 - 你三十分钟前就这么说了
- Thirty more minutes. - You said that 30 minutes ago.

1435
01:27:51,370 --> 01:27:54,370
好吧 想象一下
Well, think of it like

1436
01:27:55,180 --> 01:27:58,380
边缘
edging.

1437
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:05,990
哦 不
Oh, no.

1438
01:28:16,530 --> 01:28:18,400
今晚你想吃什么？
What do you want to do for dinner tonight?

1439
01:28:18,530 --> 01:28:20,130
哦 我要去雪莉家 记得吗？
Oh, I'm going to Shelly's, remember?

1440
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:23,240
哦 忘了
Oh. Forgot.

1441
01:28:26,740 --> 01:28:27,780
我可以来吗？
Can I come?

1442
01:28:28,310 --> 01:28:29,740
这是女生之夜
It's girls' night.

1443
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:32,410
- 我们讨论过这个 - 好的 很好
- We talked about this. - Okay. Fine.

1444
01:28:32,550 --> 01:28:35,750
- 别闷闷不乐  - 我没有闷闷不乐
- Don't mope. - I'm not moping.

1445
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:24,500
抱歉 有人排队
Sorry, there was a line.

1446
01:29:24,630 --> 01:29:25,730
我不能久留
I can't stay long.

1447
01:29:31,610 --> 01:29:33,310
- 谢谢 - 当然
- Thank you. - Sure thing.

1448
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:36,710
抱歉 我不应该点任何东西
Sorry, I shouldn't have ordered anything.

1449
01:29:38,780 --> 01:29:41,150
- 你想要我的三明治吗？ - 不 我很好
- Do you want my sandwich? - No, I'm good.

1450
01:29:51,890 --> 01:29:53,930
- 我升职了 哦 - 你好吗？
- I got a promotion. Oh. - How are you?

1451
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:55,860
恭喜
Congrats.

1452
01:29:56,830 --> 01:30:00,370
谢谢 算是吧 这是阶梯式的移动
Thanks. Sort of. It's a ladder move.

1453
01:30:01,670 --> 01:30:02,870
横向移动？
Lateral move?

1454
01:30:03,740 --> 01:30:06,040
- 什么？ - 侧面
- What? - Lateral.

1455
01:30:06,170 --> 01:30:07,880
意味着你正在横向移动
Means you're moving sideways.

1456
01:30:08,510 --> 01:30:09,710
我想你可以有一个侧梯
I guess you could have a sideways ladder,

1457
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:11,880
但我想不出它有什么用途
but I can't think of a use for it.

1458
01:30:13,550 --> 01:30:14,520
他妈的
Fuck.

1459
01:30:16,050 --> 01:30:18,590
我对很多人说过“梯子移动”
I said "ladder move" to, like, so many people.

1460
01:30:20,690 --> 01:30:23,620
嗯 单杠 那是一种侧向的梯子
Well, monkey bars. That's a sideways ladder.

1461
01:30:24,260 --> 01:30:25,230
伟大的
Great.

1462
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:32,130
那么你最近在哪儿工作？玛西说你辞职了
So where you working these days? Marcie said you quit.

1463
01:30:32,770 --> 01:30:34,900
虽然被解雇了 但她还是很善良
Fired, but that's sweet of her.

1464
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:37,710
我正在办理房地产执照
I'm in the process of getting my real estate license.

1465
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:42,980
什么 没有书籍设计？
What, no book designing?

1466
01:30:43,110 --> 01:30:45,650
我决定宁愿做一个不快乐的中产阶级
I decided I'd rather be middle class and unhappy

1467
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:48,620
比贫穷的人少一些 但不幸程度却略低一些
than poor and slightly less unhappy.

1468
01:30:48,750 --> 01:30:51,090
是的 很有道理
Yeah. Makes sense.

1469
01:30:51,690 --> 01:30:52,950
话虽如此 我确实……
And that said, I did...

1470
01:30:57,530 --> 01:31:00,260
不确定这是否品味低下 但是......
Wasn't sure if it was in poor taste or not, but...

1471
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:07,130
我认为这绝对是低级趣味
Think it's definitely poor taste.

1472
01:31:09,070 --> 01:31:10,600
是的 我现在明白了
Yeah, I can see that now.

1473
01:31:11,270 --> 01:31:13,140
- 我可以接受... - 不 不 我会...
- I can take it... - No, no, I'll...

1474
01:31:13,270 --> 01:31:16,180
我会保留它
I'll keep it.

1475
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:25,950
我打断了你的胳膊吗？
Did I break your arm?

1476
01:31:26,990 --> 01:31:29,620
呃 没关系 算是吧
Uh, unrelated. Sort of.

1477
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:32,130
对不起
Sorry.

1478
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:34,600
因为我曾经打过你
For hitting you like I did.

1479
01:31:37,430 --> 01:31:38,670
没关系
It's all right.

1480
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,940
不 不是这样的 我不应该这么做
No, it's not. I shouldn't have done that.

1481
01:31:42,940 --> 01:31:44,840
我认为我在这方面比你强
I think I outclassed you in that department.

1482
01:31:47,270 --> 01:31:48,980
是的 我只是不 嗯......
Yeah, I just don't, um...

1483
01:31:51,650 --> 01:31:54,850
我不明白怎么会有人……
I don't understand how someone could...

1484
01:31:57,820 --> 01:31:59,050
我的意思是 你是谁？
I mean, who are you?

1485
01:32:03,090 --> 01:32:05,460
你知道人们怎么说“做你自己”吗？
You know how people say "just be yourself"?

1486
01:32:08,130 --> 01:32:11,530
比如 哪个版本的我？我讨厌他们中的大多数
Like, what version of me? I hate most of them.

1487
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:17,470
但刚才和你一起出去玩的那个我 我……
But the version of me that was just hanging out with you, I...

1488
01:32:20,170 --> 01:32:22,040
我一直想成为他
I wanted to be him all the time.

1489
01:32:31,490 --> 01:32:32,420
那么 你——
So, you--

1490
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:36,590
你说你爱上了洛克
you said you were in love with Rock.

1491
01:32:38,190 --> 01:32:39,930
但我要声明 我疯了
With the caveat that I am insane.

1492
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:43,060
他曾经谈论过我吗？
He ever talk about me?

1493
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:46,030
您想要详细信息吗？
Do you want details?

1494
01:32:56,680 --> 01:32:58,080
你想要我的三明治吗？
Do you want my sandwich?

1495
01:32:58,210 --> 01:33:00,850
不 我要和 Marcie 一起去吃饭
No, I'm going to dinner with Marcie.

1496
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:03,620
所以我不能久留
So I can't stay long.

1497
01:33:05,350 --> 01:33:06,750
对 你说
Right. You said.

1498
01:33:09,690 --> 01:33:10,960
顺便问一下 玛西怎么样了？
How is Marcie, by the way?

1499
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:14,060
在 Marcie-land 每天都是好日子
Every day is a good day in Marcie-land.

1500
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:16,200
我记得
I remember.

1501
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:25,740
我就吃一口
I'll just have a bite.

1502
01:33:25,870 --> 01:33:28,780
唔
Hmm.

1503
01:33:29,740 --> 01:33:31,580
我又开始学习空手道了
I started taking karate again.

1504
01:33:34,250 --> 01:33:37,220
我们班上有个瘦子 让我想起了你
There's a skinny guy in my class, reminds me of you.

1505
01:33:39,420 --> 01:33:41,060
这些课程不是没用吗？
Aren't those classes useless?

1506
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:43,720
我听说只有在街头才能真正学会如何打架
I hear you can only really learn how to fight in the streets.

1507
01:33:45,790 --> 01:33:47,330
嗯 我们也在街上学习
Well, we learn in the streets too.

我的老师 他 呃 下班后跟着我并攻击我
My sensei, he, uh, follows me after work and attacks me.

1509
01:34:00,110 --> 01:34:01,310
你觉得我们会成为朋友吗
Do you think we would've been friends

1510
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:03,110
如果我们在不同的情况下相遇呢？
if we met under different circumstances?

1511
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:16,490
我不知道
I don't know.

1512
01:34:18,290 --> 01:34:19,690
我希望如此 但是……
I'd like to think so, but...

1513
01:34:21,830 --> 01:34:22,760
正确的
Right.

1514
01:34:27,940 --> 01:34:29,870
天啊 这个演员阵容太让人心痒了
God, this cast is so itchy.

1515

- 你戴了多久了？ - 一个月

1516

1517
01:34:39,410 --> 01:34:42,650
洛奇说你自己的脚曾经被摔断过

1518

你把保龄球掉在上面了吗？
You dropped a bowling ball on it?

1520

他说你是……好双胞胎
He said you were... the good twin.

1521
01:35:09,510 --> 01:35:10,810
那是一块砖头
It was with a brick.

1522
01:35:16,620 --> 01:35:18,320
你们好吗？有什么需要我帮忙的吗？
How are y'all doing? Can I get you anything?

1523

我们可以拿一个箱子带走吗？
