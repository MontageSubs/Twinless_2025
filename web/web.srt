节哀 我是朱迪
Hi. I'm Judy.

6
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,100
- 罗曼 - 我是罗基同事
- Roman. - I worked with Rocky.

7
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,670
抱歉
Sorry.

8
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,530
简直像幻觉 抱歉 抱歉
It's like looking at a ghost. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

9
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,520
真不想待在这儿了
Have to get out of here.

10
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,620
节哀 我是艾瑞克
Roman. Eric.

11
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:33,210
我们素未谋面 却似曾相识
We've never met, but I feel like I know you.

12
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,070
真替你难过
I'm so sorry for your loss.

13
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,210
需要的话 我都在...
I'm-I'm here if you...

14
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,910
天呐 你长得太像他了
Oh, God. Your face.

15
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,190
其实 看起来
It doesn't-- Actually, it doesn't seem like

16
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,250
不像你在尽职尽责 看起来...
you are trying to do your job. No, looks like--

17
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,030
更像是在帮倒忙
It feels like you're doing the opposite of your job

18
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,530
给我去世的哥哥
'cause it should be pretty easy to cancel

19
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,130
- 销户应该很简单的 - 还要这个吗？
- my dead brother's account. - Do you want this?

20
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,830
放哪儿好呢
I don't know.

21
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,580
妈 随便 我在打电话呢
Ma, I don't know. I'm on the phone.

22
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,040
别让我等着
No, do not put me on hold!

23
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,410
- 这些要不要？ - 我...妈 别问了
- Do you want these? - I-- Mom, please.

24
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,350
别跟我说什么别激动
Don't tell me to fucking calm down!

25
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,370
都耗了快一小时了
I've been on the phone for, like, an hour--

26
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,260
- 喂？操！ - 罗曼
- Hello? Fuck! - Roman,

27
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,080
这些到底还要不要？
do you want me to keep these or throw them away?

28
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,150
- 非得现在收拾吗？ - 家里没地方了
- Do we have to do this now? - We don't have the room,

29
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,550
你要是想要的话...
but if you wanna keep everything--

30
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,160
- 明天再弄行吗？ - 不行
- Can we just do this tomorrow, please? - No, we can't.

31
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,760
- 为什么？ - 明天我就走人了
- Why? - Because I'm going back tomorrow.

32
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,320
行 我又不走 别管了
Okay, but I'm gonna be here, so just leave it.

33
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,890
你真打算自己收拾吗？
You're gonna pack up this entire apartment?

34
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,280
- 对 对 - 哦 真有意思
- Yes. Yes. - Oh, that's rich.

35
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,600
我就自己来 怎么了
I'll do it myself-- What?

36
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,050
我觉得你待在这里 对你没好处
I don't think you should stay here. I don't think it's good for you.

37
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,980
得了吧 你不懂什么对我好
Oh, come on. You don't know what's good for me,

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,720
妈 从来没懂过 好吧？
Mom. You never knew what was good for me. Okay?

39
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,470
行 行
All right, Okay.

40
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,000
- 开玩笑吗？ - 好吧 那算了
- You kidding me? - Well, then never mind.

41
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,640
- 我不管了 - 很好
- I won't help you. - Good.

42
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,170
- 全部都你自己做 - 我就是这个意思
- You can do all this yourself. - That's what I'm saying.

43
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,540
- 我回酒店后 - 抓紧走
- I'll go back to the hotel. - Go.

44
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,940
- 别打电话求我 - 热烈欢送你这混蛋！
- Don't call me. - Good. Good for fucking you!

45
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,000
够了！
Time-out!

46
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,910
罗曼
Roman.

47
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,320
你需要帮助
You need help.

48
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,910
你才需要帮助
You need help.

49
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,550
嗯 确实
Well, that's true.

50
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,710
大家好
Hello, everyone.

51
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,330
现在七点了 我们开始吧
It's seven o'clock, so I say let's get started.

52
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,780
今天有几位新朋友
I see some new faces here today,

53
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,860
大家来做个有趣的转圈轮流介绍
so I thought it would be fun to go in a circle.

54
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,350
说出你的名字
Say your name,

55
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,530
一个与名字首字相同的食物
a vegetable that starts with the same first letter

56
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:09,400
以及一件不怀念你双胞胎的事
and one thing you don't miss about your twin.

57
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,200
我先来 夏洛特 夏威夷果
Charlotte. Carrot.

58
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:16,770
我一点也不怀念夏琳抢我男朋友的事
I don't miss Claire stealing my boyfriend.

59
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,140
不 我开玩笑的
No, I'm kidding.

60
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,840
别当真 不会真这样自我介绍的
I'm kidding. We won't go in a circle.

61
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,180
但夏琳确实抢过我男朋友
But Claire, she really did steal my boyfriend.

62
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,830
那男人分不清我们俩 但这也算吧？
He couldn't tell us apart. But it still counts, right?

63
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,990
我怀念她的笑声
I miss her laugh.

64
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,730
我们总是一起笑
We always laughed together.

65
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,820
我们还说好要演那段阿伯特和科斯特洛的双簧
We talked about doing this Abbott and Costello routine.

66
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:41,800
{\an9}【阿伯特与科斯特洛：上世纪中叶美式喜剧二人组】

67
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,750
但我太害羞了
But I was too shy.

68
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,230
我对自己说 做单口喜剧就行了
So, I said to myself I'll try stand-up.

69
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,000
嗯 我要在你们身上试几个段子
Yep, and I'm about to test jokes on you,

70
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,490
别介意
so bear with me.

71
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,510
准备好了吗？好
Okay, you ready? All right.

72
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,080
有双胞胎的请举手
Raise your hand if you have a twin.

73
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,770
好样的
Okay.

74
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,110
来参加的双胞胎还挺多的
This is a good crowd.

75
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,680
发现没 人们总爱问
You know, so many people, they're always asking,

76
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,310
“谁更大？”
"Who's older?"

77
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,440
我最大 因为她死了
I am now that she's dead.

78
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,860
做双胞胎久了 另一半的不同
As a twin, it's like you internalize the difference

79
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,900
都会刻在你心里
between you and your other half.

80
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,960
夏琳是外向的 夏琳是更漂亮的那个
Claire's the outgoing one, Claire's the beautiful one,

81
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,680
夏琳是得性病的那个
Claire's the one with chlamydia.

82
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,270
我既气又难过
I was so upset

83
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:24,010
她得了性病居然没带上我
when she got chlamydia without me.

84
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,470
我们本该什么事都一起做
We're supposed to do everything together.

85
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,240
别吃那个 吃着像蛋蛋
Oh, I wouldn't eat that. Tastes like balls.

86
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:55,800
好啊 我喜欢蛋蛋
Mm, I like balls.

87
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,830
哦
Oh.

88
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,730
哎
Mm.

89
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:03,530
噢 天呐 太难吃了
Oh, my God, that's so bad.

90
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,990
你是不是...
Are you, uh...

91
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,960
我是啥？
Am I...?

92
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,670
你刚才说你喜欢蛋蛋 所以...
Oh, just-- You said you like balls, so...

93
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,870
我哥哥罗基也是同性恋
Rocky, my brother, was gay.

94
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,160
你那边你兄弟也是吗？
Was your twin?

95
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,650
呃 不是
Um... No.

96
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,410
好
Right.

97
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,170
挺奇怪的 是吧？
It's weird, isn't it?

98
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,840
这叫表观遗传学啦
Uh, epigenetics.

99
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,980
在你的DNA之外
They're the things you inherit on top of your DNA.

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,490
影响基因表达的东西 这能解释差异
They may account for discrepancies between identical twins.

101
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,020
对了 你会晕车吗？
Hey, do you get carsick?

102
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,220
有时会 为什么问？
Sometimes. Why?

103
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,220
小时候罗基
Rocky always had to sit in the front seat

104
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,680
总要坐前排
when we were kids, and...

105
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,230
我就想
I don't know, I just thought

106
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:54,180
也许这跟所谓的 同性倾向基因 有关吧
maybe that was connected to, like, the gay gene.

107
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,950
要是有的话
If there is one.

108
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,110
不是说真有
Not that there is one.

109
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:01,870
我不是科学家 只是随便瞎猜
Uh, it was just an idea. I'm no scientist.

110
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,410
有个所谓的同性倾向基因
Um, well, there is a gay gene.

111
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,340
好像把橙当蓝 把蓝当橙
Uh, we see orange as blue and blue as orange.

112
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,230
所以时尚圈里
That's why there's so many homosexuals

113
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,540
- 同性恋多 - 哦 是吧？
- in the fashion industry. - Oh. See?

114
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,150
看吧 我就说嘛
Well, there you go.

115
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,390
抱歉 你知道我是在开玩笑吧？
I'm sorry, you know that I'm joking, right?

116
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,350
那 那不是真滴
That-that's not true.

117
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,580
嗯 知道 我知道
Yeah. No, I knew that.

118
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,480
好的
Okay.

119
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:30,120
我叫 丹 丹尼斯
I'm D-- uh, I'm Dennis.

120
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,220
我叫罗曼
Roman.

121
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,050
{\an3}你双胞胎叫什么名字？
What was your twin's name?

122
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,050
{\an1}你饿吗？
Are you hungry?

123
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,710
- 抱歉 什么？ - 只是想问你
- Sorry, what? - Sorry. I was just gonna ask

124
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,560
喜欢不喜欢三明治啦
if you like sandwiches. Never mind.

125
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,920
你确定不吃点？
You sure you don't want some?

126
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,310
嗯 不了
Mm, I'm okay.

127
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,440
- 才想起来吃过了 - 嗯
- I forgot I already ate. - Mm.

128
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,030
我不喝咖啡 咖啡对我不好
I don't drink caffeine 'cause it does things to me.

129
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:12,120
后来布拉德让我改喝茶 花草茶
Then Brad converted me to tea. Herbal tea.

130
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,910
布拉德是我在纽约爱过的人
Brad was this guy I was in love with back in New York.

131
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,710
有一天我翻他浏览记录
Then one day, I found all these goat-fucking videos

132
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,830
- 全是跟羊兽交的视频 - 哇
- in his browser history. - Whoa.

133
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,800
我怕冲突 选择了旁敲侧击
I tried to get him to confess, but I avoid conflict,

134
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,610
下馆子时我常点羊奶酪
so at dinner, I'd order goat cheese on an entrée,

135
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:30,410
有次他在我脖子上亲 我学起羊咩咩叫...
or one time when he was sucking on my neck, I bleated like...

136
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,320
想看他反应 结果才发现他早看穿了
See how he'd react. So, I know he knew I knew.

137
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,160
可能因此甩了我
Maybe that's why he broke up with me.

138
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,740
他甩了你？
He broke up with you?

139
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,620
嗯 我配不上他啦
Mm. He was the better catch.

140
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,900
我对罗基的男友一无所知
I don't know anything about Rocky's boyfriends.

141
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,370
我们没聊过那类话题
We didn't really talk about that stuff.

142
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,190
你们都聊什么？
What stuff did you talk about?

143
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,530
袜子
Socks.

144
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,580
- 袜子？ - 我袜子老破洞
- Socks? - I get holes in all my socks.

145
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,370
我觉得是忘剪脚趾甲的缘故
I think it's 'cause I forget to cut my toenails.

146
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:00,700
罗基却说是因为我老买地摊货
Rocky thinks it's 'cause I shop at Walmart.

147
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,020
那是我们间最后一次聊天
That was our last conversation.

148
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,120
对不起
I'm sorry.

149
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,620
又不是你的错
Not your fault.

150
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,370
你跟你兄弟住一起吗？
So, did you live with your brother?

151
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,270
没啦 呃 有啦 大学时是
Uh, no. Yeah, in college.

152
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:27,080
罗基上大学了 我则留在了莫斯科
Mm. Rocky went to college. I stayed in Moscow.

153
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,290
爱达荷州的莫斯科？
Moscow, Idaho?

154
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,230
要不然呢？
You know another one?

155
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,030
另一个莫斯科？
Another Moscow?

156
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,230
后来我得搬出我妈的地下室
I need to get out of my mom's basement.

157
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,490
她居然开始向我收房租
She started charging me rent.

158
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,940
她能怎么收？
Hmm. And how's she taking it?

159
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,870
现金收
Cash.

160
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,970
她心里怎么想？
How is she feeling?

161
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
她心理有毛病
She's a nut bucket.

162
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,560
她最宠罗基 所以...
Rocky was her favorite, so...

163
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,740
哎 我也没人宠
Mm. I'm nobody's favorite.

164
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,230
做双胞胎真让我吃亏
Feel like being a twin kind of fucked me.

165
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,830
小时候我就喜欢单干...
I never needed anyone else as a kid, you know, but now...

166
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,890
现在感觉跟筷子处都要落单
feel like I can't make friends with a fork.

167
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,820
每周见一两次都太少了
Once, twice a week's not enough.

168
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,430
我想一直有人陪 我 我太需要陪伴了
I want to hang out all the time. I'm-I'm too needy.

169
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,480
我也讨厌做什么都一个人
I hate doing things alone.

170
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,160
一个人做饭 一个人拆信 一个人收衣服
Cooking meals, opening mail, folding laundry.

171
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,420
对 两人做事 事半功倍
Yeah. So much faster with two people.

172
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,140
可不是嘛 老实说 发明床笠床套的人
Right? I mean, honestly, whoever invented the fitted sheet

173
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,150
真该挨揍 吊起来打
should be flagellated. And not the fun kind.

174
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,390
你懂我
You get me.

175
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,180
罗基！
Rocky!

176
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:57,440
好久不见 近来可好？剪头发啦？
Long time no see. How are you? Did you get a haircut?

177
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,330
哦 呃 是啊
Oh. Uh, yeah.

178
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,670
太巧了
This is so random.

179
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:03,010
我前阵子还在想你
I was literally thinking about you the other day.

180
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,750
看到篇文章 说日语里有个词
I was reading an article about how there's a Japanese word

181
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,890
专门形容那种死在自己屋里...
for people who die in their apartments...

182
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,770
...好久才被发现的人
...and it takes a long time

183
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,210
甚至好几年
for anyone to find the body-- Years even.

184
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,620
大多是老人
Old men mostly.

185
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,990
这在日本算个大问题
It's like a big problem over there.

186
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,510
啊 太惨了
Ah, that's awful.

187
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,770
对吧
Isn't it?

188
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,160
你肯定早知道了
Anyway, I figured you knew this already

189
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,270
你以前在东京待过 对吧
because you used to live in Tokyo, right?

190
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:25,430
对 嗯
Right. Yeah.

191
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,170
嗯 那词叫什么来着？
Yeah, what is the word again?

192
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,880
哦 呃...

Hey, how do you know if lemons are ripe?

200
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,690
熟的是黄色 没熟的是绿色
Uh, it's yellow. Unripe lemons are green.

201
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,600
那为啥摆这么多没熟的？
So why do they got so many unripe ones out?

202
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,090
那是青柠啦
Those are limes.

203
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,540
你还好吧？
Are you okay?

204
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,400
别笑我行不行？
Can you not laugh at me?

'Cause... then I can know better.

容我直说下
Would now be a good time to point out

211
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:15,080
你知道秃头脑袋才光吧？
I think you meant to say, "sharpest tool in the shed?"

212
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,420
嗯
Yeah.

213
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,440
你该说脑袋灵光
Maybe you meant to say, "brightest bulb in the box."

214
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,200
- 对 我就是这个意思 - 嗯 嗯

Oh, just browsing. I pick books based on the cover.

225

不该这样选书吧

你觉得该有死刑吗？
Do you believe in the death penalty?

你在想这个？
That's what you were thinking about?

255
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:28,970
我觉得不
I guess no. Because there's a chance

256
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:33,580
可能会误杀无辜 而死亡无法挽回
of executing someone innocent, and death is irrevocable.

257
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:38,650
是啊 有些事就是没后悔药的
Yeah, but there's some things you can't take back.

True.

好几件

有一次...
This one time...

00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,070
罗基和我 呃...
Rocky and I, uh...

00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,350
我们那会儿十六岁
we were 16.

265
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,120
然后...
And, um...

266
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,950
是我害死他的
It was my fault he died.

267
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,140
- 什么？ - 是我的错
- What? - It was my fault.

268
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:34,910
丹恩本该来机场接我
Dean was supposed to pick me up from the airport.

269
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,000
但他忘了
But he forgot.

270
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:41,340
我本可直接叫辆出租车
And I could've just called a cab,

271
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:43,620
但我就是想让他来接
but I wanted him to pick me up,

272
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:46,950
所以我一遍又一遍给他打电话
so I called him again and again and again,

273
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:49,240
不停地催他
and I was relentless.

274
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,390
结果他超速了
So, he broke the speed limit.

275
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,420
你们也能猜到结局
And you can guess where this is going.

276
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,540
他出了车祸
He crashed.

277
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,910
我对他说的最后一句话是...
My last words to him were...

278
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,040
“去死吧”
"Fuck you."

279
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,500
所以 这就是我的故事
So... that's my story.

280
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,620
五年级那年 我左眼长了针眼
In fifth grade, I had a stye in my left eye.

281
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,450
正好是拍学年照那天 那时...
On school picture day. It was...

282
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,210
又红又肿
swollen and red.

283
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,940
像极了青蛙眼
And I looked like Forest Whitaker.

284
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,210
我求着爸妈让我呆在家
So, I begged to stay home.

285
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,240
但都不同意
But I was overruled,

286
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:33,330
所以丹恩替我去拍
so Dean pretended to be me for the yearbook.

287
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,860
他真救了我
He saved me. Um...

288
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,290
他总是在我糟糕的时候出现
He was always there on the bad days.

289
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,670
当阿什利在街上
When Ashley from down the street, uh,

290
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:49,280
取笑我的粉色铅笔盒时 他就骂她“黄毛怪”
made fun of my pink pencil box, he called her a butter troll.

291
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:53,910
继父把我赶出家时
Uh, when my stepfather asked me not to come home anymore,

292
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,300
丹恩紧紧握着我的手
Dean held my hand.

293
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,210
感觉...
Feels like, uh...

294
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,460
现在每天都是糟糕的日子
every day's a bad day now.

295
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,590
呃 对不起...
Um, sorry, uh...

296
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,040
扎心的痛 真是心如刀割
It hurts. Like, um, it's literally painful.

297
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,740
可我喜欢 因为...
But I like it because

298
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:22,350
要是没了这痛 那就说明...
if I don't have the pain, then...

299
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,860
他就彻底走了
he's really gone.

300
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,470
我就彻底孤身一人了
And I'm actually alone.

你和你父母亲关系呢？
Are you close with your parents?

333

不行 别用问题来回问题
No, you can't answer a question with a question.

334
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,240
我和我爸挺亲啦
I'm close with my father.

我们不太说话
We don't talk much.

是种无言的亲近 他住在日本
It's an unspoken closeness. He lives in Japan.

He's a professor in Osaka.

340
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,020

- Wait, really? Are you fluent? - Mm-hmm.

341
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,580
嗯 准确说 我听得很溜
Well, I mean, I-I understand fluently,

342
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,540
只是口音很怪
but my accent's sort of-- Anyway.

343
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,910
别让我开口就好
Uh, so don't ask me to say anything.

344
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,230
（日语）行啊
じゃあ

俺が話すから お前が聞けよ

348
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:33,670
- 你怎么会说日语？ - 你这瘦巴巴的骗子
- Why do you speak Japanese? - You're a skinny fucking liar.

349
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:37,320
因为我在东京待过 干嘛骗我？
Because I lived in Tokyo. Why would you lie to me?

350
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,930
能翻篇啦吗？
Is this over?

351
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:42,180
不能 你很萌
No, you're cute.

我有点迷上你了
I'm kind of obsessed with you.

353
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:47,290
- 等等 你车停哪儿了？ - 我们走过了
- Wait, where did you park? - No, we passed it.

354
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:50,950
- 你为什么不早说？ - 我在跟着你
- Why didn't you say anything? - I was following you.

355
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,850
噢 你喜欢跟着我吗？
Aw. You like following me?

356
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,910
说个你从没说过的秘密
Tell me something you've never told anyone.

357

- Oh, that's so hot. - Yeah? Your turn.

360
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,540
初二科学课上 我把仓鼠爸爸
Uh, in eighth-grade science, I put the father hamster

361
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,080
放回仓鼠妈妈的笼子里
back in the cage with the mother hamster,

362
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,880
结果他吃了两个仓鼠宝宝

363

噢 这有点重口
Oh, that's kind of kinky.

要是我们在一起 衣服就能互穿啦
If we were in a relationship, we could share clothes.

365
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:21,980
我们的尺码不一样吧
I don't think we're the same size.

366
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,950
- 你多高？ - 一米七八
- How tall are you? - Five-ten.

367
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:26,370
我也是一米七八 双胞胎啊

- 我还真是双胞胎 - 什么？
- You know, I am a twin. - What?

- 我是双胞胎 - 你有个双胞胎？
- I'm a twin. - You have a twin?

371
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,060
是的 掐我乳头 验证一下
Yeah. Pinch my nipple.

372
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,870
- 你在逗我吧？ - 没有
- You messing with me right now? - No.

373
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:40,090
你们是单卵的吗？
Are you monozygotic?

374
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,070
- 指同卵的话 是的 - 哦
- If that means identical, yeah. - Oh!

直到知道性是什么
...until I learned what sex was.

382
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,420
真不敢相信你有个双胞胎
I can't believe you have a twin.

383
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:58,810
- 我超爱双胞胎滴 - 是吗？
- I love twins. - Yeah?

384
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,490
- 是啊 - 他叫罗曼

Oh, Rocky and Roman. I fucking love that.

他也在波特兰吗？在这栋楼里吗？
Does he live in Portland? Does he live in this building?

你是不是更兴奋了？
Did you just get harder?

388
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,120
你们有互换过身份吗？

What's the longest sentence you've ever said in unison?

“她只想再要个贝果”
"All that she wants is another bagel."

393

天呐 我要高潮啦
Oh, my God, I'm gonna come.

394
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,430
你怎么这么迷双胞胎啊？
So, why are you so obsessed with twins?

395
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,450
我不想说
Mm. I don't want to tell you.

396
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,170
行了 你迟早会说的 说吧
Oh, you're gonna tell me anyway. Come on.

397
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,520
有点尴尬
It's embarrassing.

398

你的害羞今晚都裸奔跑马拉松去了
Well, you've crossed that threshold tonight multiple times.

399
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,310
我曾幻想 我妈带走了我
I constructed this fantasy that my mother took me

400
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,210
我爸带走了我的双胞胎
and my father took my twin,

401
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,950
不让我们碰面
and they never wanted us to meet,

402
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:05,420
所以不允许我去日本看他
and that's why I was never allowed to visit him in Japan.

403
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,730
你当真这样想？
Did you really believe that?

404
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,560
嗯 也许吧
Mm, maybe.

405
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:13,600
我也说不好 反正我想相信
I don't know. I wanted to.

406
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,460
大家常说生来孤单
They say we're born alone,

407
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,900
活着孤单 死了也孤单
we live alone and we die alone,

408
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,760
但双胞胎不一样
but... for twins, that isn't true.

409
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:25,950
你有个天生的知己
You have a built-in best friend.

410
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,930
不啊 双胞胎也会孤独的
No, twins can get lonely too.

411
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,210
我就非常孤独
I'm incredibly lonely.

412
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,030
得了吧 你这是安慰话
You're just saying that to make me feel better about myself.

413
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,870
我没有 我是认真的
I'm not. I mean it.

414
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,360
我是认真的
I mean it.

415
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,020
我很...
I'm very adept at...

416
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,580
很会给别人付出
sharing myself with other people.

417
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,440
但有时候会被掏空
But sometimes I can run empty.

418
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,420
因为...
Because...

419
00:25:55,290 --> 00:26:00,230
我总在付出 收获不多
I'm always giving and not so much receiving.

420
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,070
和罗曼本来是平衡的
With Roman, it's fifty-fifty.

421
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,540
曾经是 现在我们...
Well, it was. I mean, we...

422
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,480
我们也不怎么说话了
we don't really talk that much anymore.

423
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,930
怎么了？
What happened?

424
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,250
就是生活吧
Just life.

425
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:16,960
我们本该形影不离 但...
Growing up, we were attached by the hip, obviously, but...

426
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,870
但长大后差别特别大
We're very different... now.

427
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,010
我觉得...
And I think that's...

428
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,890
这对他来说更难受
I think it's harder for him.

429
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,560
有张我们小时候的合影
There's a photo of us as kids where we're wearing

430
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:38,680
穿着一模一样的睡衣
these matching pajamas, and to this day,

431
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,400
到现在我都认不出哪一个是我
I could not tell you which one I am in the picture.

432
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,930
很离谱吧
It's crazy.

433
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,720
我曾经是“我们”
I was "We."

434
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,050
现在只是“我”了
And now, I'm "I."

435
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,030
你还惦记他吗？
You miss him.

436
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:54,130
非常惦记
Very much.

437
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,510
他是我最亲的人
He's my favorite person.

438
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:07,260
他觉得我是好的一方 其实他才是
He thinks I'm the good twin, but it's him.

439
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,640
小时候
When we were really little age,

440
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:13,450
有次在楼梯上 我摔断了大脚趾
I broke my big toe tripping up the stairs one time,

441
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:16,300
结果那天晚上
and later that same day,

442
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:21,460
罗曼回家时脚也骨折了
Roman comes home and has a broken foot.

443
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,740
他不想让我独自受苦
He didn't want me to be in pain by myself.

444
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:27,760
天啦 这真暖心
Oh. Oh, my God, that's adorable.

445
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,530
他可能拿保龄球砸的
He probably, like, dropped a bowling ball

446
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,840
或者类似的
on it or something.

447
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:32,200
- 天呐 - 我知道
- My God. - I know.

448
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,240
我都想骨折下啦
I've never broken a bone.

449
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:42,360
呸 呸 呸 完了
Oh, no. Now, it's gonna happen.

450
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,530
这下要应验了 别这么说
It's like a thing. You can't say that.

451
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,090
好吧
Okay.

452
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:52,630
你该给他打个电话
You should call him.

453
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,770
嗯 我会打的
Yeah, I should.

454
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,420
现在就打 我要听
You should call him and I'll listen.

455
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,850
噢 天呐
Oh, Jesus.

456
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,680
心急吃不了臭豆腐
Hold your hippos.

457
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,870
不行 超急啦
No, I can't.

458
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,240
我得修补你那破了的双胞胎关系
I must amend your broken twinship.

459
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:09,940
我这辈子都在等这个机会
My whole life has been waiting for this moment.

460
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:13,660
你人真好
You're really sweet.

461
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:21,840
你当双胞胎会很合适
I think you'd be a good twin.

462
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,990
我开始爱上你了
I'm falling in love with you.

463
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:45,990
我可听见了
I heard that.

464
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:09,150
我喜欢稿件用这个字体
I like this font for the OM.

465
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:11,730
这字体像苦力乱涂的字
Ugh, lobster? You're killing me.

466
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,160
你这话怕是冒犯了血汗工人
That's offensive to sweatshop workers,

467
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,660
你不觉得吗？
don't you think?

468
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,360
能问你个私事吗？
Hey, can I ask you a personal question?

469
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:22,190
我不喜欢在公司谈我的私事
I don't really like to talk about my personal life at work.

470
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,250
是我的私事
Well, it's about my personal life.

471
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,840
行 讲吧
Sure, that's fine.

472
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:28,550
我跟一个男生约会很投缘
So I had this amazing date with a guy,

473
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,520
我俩都爱特好吃的三明治
and we both like really good sandwiches,

474
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,920
我周一发消息问他“今晚一起吃三明治？”
so I texted him on Monday, "Sandwiches for dinner?"

475
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,190
又问“明天 周三 周四 周五 哪天行？”
"How's tomorrow or Wednesday or Thursday or Friday?"

476
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:37,150
结果他都没回
And he didn't respond.

477
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,960
真可惜
That's too bad.

478
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,960
- 换棵树吧 - 我还没说完
- Onto the next. - Well, I'm not done.

479
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,590
周二我又追了条
So I followed up with him on Tuesday,

480
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,960
说“其实周四不行” 实际能
"Actually, can't do Thursday," even though I could.

481
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,640
“明天怎么样 或者周三周五？”
"How's tomorrow, aka Wednesday or Friday?"

482
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,070
最后还加了“你今天过的怎样？”
PS, how was your day?"

483
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,940
结果依旧没回
And nothing.

484
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:53,140
你觉得下次什么时候再问？
How long do you think I should wait before I text him again?

485
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,350
再也别问了
Never text him again.

486
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,710
他不喜欢你
He doesn't like you.

487
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,180
嗨 丹尼斯
Hi, Dennis.

488
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,020
- 嗨 玛茜 - 今天忙不忙？
- Hey, Marcie. - How's your day going?

489
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,890
呃 还好 能问你个私事吗？ - 嗯
Ugh, well. Can I ask you a personal question? - Mm-hmm.

490
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,620
追一个真命天子
How many consecutive texts can you send

491
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,390
能发多少条消息还不丢脸？
to a potential soulmate before you stop respecting yourself?

492
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:11,890
- 我已经发了五条 - 他还没回吗？
- I'm at five. - And he hasn't responded?

493
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,830
没回 我们那次约会简直完美
No. And we had the best date ever.

494
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,400
聊了八小时 睡了四小时
Eight hours awake and four hours asleep.

495
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,140
我真不懂 他是故意不理我吗？
I don't understand. Is he blowing me off?

496
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:19,470
不 不可能 谁会忽视你啦？
No, that's silly. Why would anyone ignore you?

497
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:21,270
你人多好呀
You're such a great guy.

498
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,380
也许他太忙了
Maybe he's just really busy.

499
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:25,100
我有时候忙起来
Sometimes when the phones are really busy,

500
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:27,660
也会忘了好几天才回
I forget to reply to things until days later.

501
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,640
有人只有再看到你
I think some people forget how much you mean to them

502
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,190
才想起来你有多重要
until they see your face, you know?

503
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,040
俗话说 眼不见 心不念
Like out of sight, out of mind.

504
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,850
我想去他家惊喜造访
I kind of just wanna show up at his door,

505
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,360
像卡罗尔·金歌里那样
like that Carole King song.

506
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,420
{\an7}【卡罗尔·金：美国怀旧抒情女歌手】

507
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:37,530
这很浪漫是吧？
That's romantic, right?

508
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,120
也许 哦 有可能滴
Maybe. It could be. Yeah.

509
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,680
你比我更了解他
I mean, you know him better than I do,

510
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,540
跟着你直觉走就好啦
so I say go with your gut.

511
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:45,540
你说得太对了
You're so right.

512
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:47,390
我就知道该问你
I knew you were the person to ask.

513
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:51,840
前台 请讲
Reception.

514
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:55,990
谁啊？
Hello?

515
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:57,990
快递
UPS.

516
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:00,030
好 门开了
Oh, okay.

517
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:15,510
- 快点 - 来了
- Come on. - Okay.

518
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:18,270
真应付不了你这套
I can't keep up with this drama.

519
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,940
- 真假的？ - 真的
- Is it really? - Yeah.

520
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,240
你认真的吗？
Are you serious?

521
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,330
天呐
Jesus Christ.

522
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:02,110
别挡道
I'm traversing here!

523
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,710
- 我一直想说这句 - 等等
- I've always wanted to say that. - Wait,

524
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:05,790
太性感了
that was so sexy.

525
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,410
罗基！
Rocky!

526
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,260
去死吧！
Fuck you!

527
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:17,890
你认识那个人吗？
Do you know that guy?

528
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:20,080
认识 给我两分钟
Yeah. Give me two minutes.

529
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:23,890
嗨
Hi.

530
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:29,200
我正要打电话给你
I was gonna call you.

531
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,390
你好 这是丹尼斯·本弗的语音信箱
Hi. You've reached the voicemail of Dennis Benver.

532
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:36,200
抱歉 我现在没法接电话
I'm sorry I can't get to the phone right now.

533
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:39,480
我会尽快回电
I'll try calling you back at a future time and date.

534
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:42,910
你好 这是丹尼斯的留言箱
Hi. You've reached the voicemail of Dennis.

535
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,680
真抱歉没接到你的来电
I'm so sorry I missed your call,

536
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:46,170
留个名字和号码
but if you leave your name and your number,

537
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:49,300
我会立马回电
I'll get back to you in a reasonable time.

538
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,160
感谢来电 请留言
Thanks for calling. Leave a message.

539
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:56,230
抱歉 您拨打的电话暂时无法接通
I'm sorry. The call you entered cannot be completed as dialed.

540
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,190
请稍后再拨
Please hang up and try again.

541
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:02,360
如需帮助 请致电您的运营商
If you need help, hang up and then call your operator.

542
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:07,570
嘿...
Hey, uh...

543
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:11,780
反正没人会听到的
Nobody's ever gonna hear this. Um...

544
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:14,600
我曾接过一通陌生来电
I answered a call from an unknown number once,

545
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:17,640
他说“我想你了
and he said, "Hey, I was thinking about you.

546
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,850
今晚有什么安排？”
What are you doing tonight?"

547
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:24,910
后来我和他一起做了个草莓蛋糕
And we baked a strawberry shortcake.

548
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,610
早上
And in the morning,

549
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:30,430
我还去找剩蛋糕
I went looking for another slice.

550
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:34,400
才记起那不过是场梦
I forgot it was just a dream.

551
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:16,540
别紧张 我们都挺友好的
We don't bite.

552
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,220
哦 抱歉 我好像迷失方向了
Oh, sorry. I think I'm lost.

553
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,840
我懂
I understand.

554
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:23,700
进来旁听也可以
You can just listen if you want.

555
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:28,460
你的双胞胎怎么称呼？
What's your twin's name?

556
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:37,220
我们小时候 罗基很怕黑
Rocky was scared of the dark when we were kids.

557
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,820
我们睡的是上下铺
We had bunk beds,

558
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,680
但他老是和我挤上铺
but me and him would always share the top bunk.

559
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,090
他觉得这样怪物就抓不到他
So, the monsters couldn't get him.

560
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:54,770
但有一晚 他说他才不怕
Then one night, he said that he wasn't afraid.

561
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,580
说我怕 是为了陪我
And that I was the one who was afraid.

562
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,750
他这话把我气翻了
Fucking pissed me off.

563
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,770
大概我们已经大到了不需要同床
We were probably too old to be sharing a bed

564
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,500
反正当时就那样
at that point, anyway.

565
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,830
我 我也不知道为什么想说这事
I don't-- I don't know why I was telling that story.

566
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:00,550
- 嗨 丹尼斯 - 嗷 吓死我了！
- Hi, Dennis! - Oh, fuck me!

567
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:03,220
喔 对不起 不是故意吓你的
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.

568
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,630
我以为都走光了
I thought I was the last one here.

569
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,220
你还在加班吗？
Are you still working?

570
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,980
不 我在学习
No, I'm studying.

571
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,430
准备律师考试
For the LSAT.

572
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,650
我不知道你想当律师
I didn't know you wanted to be a lawyer.

573
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,990
真厉害呀
That's so cool! Wow!

574
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:19,930
行了 晚安不送
Okay, well, have a good night.

575
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,380
好的 再见 丹尼斯
Okay! Bye, Dennis.

576
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:24,400
哦 加油啊
Oh, and good luck.

577
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,710
- 喂？ - 喂
- Hello? - Hey.

578
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:43,530
是我 罗曼
It's Roman.

579
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:44,600
嘿
Hey.

580
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:47,410
能陪我买东西吗？
You wanna get groceries with me?

581
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,100
可以啊 我正打算去超市
Yeah! I've been, um, meaning to go to the store.

罗基 你怎么活...
Rocky!

597
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:50,040
哦 哇 你是...
Oh. Wow. You...

598
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:52,860
失礼了 你是罗基的弟弟吧？
Sorry, you must be Rocky's brother?

599
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,970
是的 是我
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

600
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,340
抱歉 节哀顺变
Um, I'm so sorry for your loss.

601
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,090
谢了 你有来参加葬礼吗？
Thanks. Were you at the service or...

602
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:02,890
没有 当时在大溪地岛出差
No, I was-- I was in Tahiti, for work.

603
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:06,510
不过 他出事时我在场
Uh, but I was-- I was there when he died.

604
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:08,470
噢 你就是那个人
Oh, you're that guy.

605
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,130
我们只是想去买酸奶冰淇淋
We were just trying to get some froyo,

606
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:14,000
突然有个疯子冲我们大喊大叫
and this crazy fucking lunatic, like, starts screaming at us.

607
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,810
于是 罗基走到马路中间
And so, Rocky stepped into the street,

608
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,810
那辆车突然冲了出来
and this car came out of, like, nowhere,

609
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:19,530
接着就是碰撞声
and I heard this crunching sound.

610
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,250
哇 好像我说太多了
Wow. Um, you don't need to hear all that.

611
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:25,310
抱歉 我也正在换心理医生
I'm sorry. I'm in the process of switching therapists.

612
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:29,880
那个疯子长什么样？
Did you get a look at the crazy screaming guy or...

613
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,590
说实话 事情发生得太快了
I couldn't tell you, honestly. It just-- It happened so fast.

614
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,570
我没看清
Uh, I didn't get a good look at him.

615
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,430
我只是一直在想
Oh. I've just, uh, thought a lot about

616
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:42,090
碰到那人怎么收拾他
what I would do to that guy if I ever saw him.

617
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:45,110
把他那该死的蛋蛋 从嗓子里拽出来
Rip his fucking testicles right out of his throat,

618
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,380
打个领带 再给他从尿道塞回去
shove them back down through his own dick hole,

619
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:49,400
再从肛门拽出来
back out his ass.

620
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:53,240
把他脸揍得连亲妈都认不出来
Pummel his fucking face till he was past his expiration date.

621
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,210
嗨 抱歉 我不是...
Hi. I'm sorry. I didn't--

622
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,700
不是故意打断你们聊天的 但...
I didn't mean to interrupt your conversation, but, um...

623
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,280
咦！
Oh!

624
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:06,150
我们以前见过吗？
Do I know you?

625
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,120
哎呦 您儿认错了 我是鲁伯儿
No, sorry. I'm-I'm Rupert.

626
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,370
- 正宗伦敦银儿 - 哦
- I'm just visiting from London. - Oh.

627
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,720
老常儿碰了
But it happens to me all the time, actually.

628
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,220
就这脸儿 老被银儿认错
One of those faces. All the time.

629
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,380
老得解释儿
I always say that.

630
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:16,130
好吧 行
Okay. Well, that must be,

631
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,330
挺好的
that must be very nice.

632
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,800
算了 我就是打个招呼
Anyway, I just wanted to say "Hi,"

633
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,300
嗯 抱歉 有点唐突了
and, um, sorry this was awkward,

634
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,520
总之 请节哀
but, yeah, my condolences.

635
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:25,790
- 保重 鲁伯儿 - 谢了
- Bye, Rupert. - Thanks.

636
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,530
你也保重
Have a good one.

637
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:31,620
刚才搞什么鬼？
What the hell was that?

638
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,540
我遇到喜欢的人
I start talking in different accents

639
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:35,570
就会换口音
when I find someone attractive.

640
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,660
本能反应啦
It's a defense mechanism.

641
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,600
真的？
Wait, shit.

642
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:40,880
- 我去把他叫回来 - 别！
- Let me go get him back. - No!

643
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:44,690
他算你的菜吗？
So was he your type?

644
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,680
我没明确的喜好
I don't think I have a type.

645
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,890
我公司有个同性恋同事
You know, there's a gay guy at work.

646
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,380
叫萨米
Sam.

647
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,670
你该见见他 我觉得你们挺合得来
You should meet him. I think you'd really get along.

648
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,510
听起来有点像“你们都是老乡
You know, that's sort of like, "You're both Asian.

649
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,440
肯定聊得来”那套
I'm sure you have lots of Asian things to talk about."

650
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,770
不是那意思 只是想给你牵线
No, man, I'm trying to hook you up.

651
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,900
别误会
Come on.

652
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:10,550
你喜欢哪种女生？
What kind of girls are you into?

653
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,090
要有胸
I like boobs.

654
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:18,320
但真心说 找个好女孩就行
But honestly, at this point, I just wanna meet a nice girl.

655
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:21,070
好女孩就没胸吗？
Nice girls don't have boobs?

656
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,260
你要是遇到有的 记得告诉我
If you find one, let me know.

657
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,050
要一起结还是分开付？
Together or separate?

658
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:27,020
{\an1}一起结
Together.

659
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:27,020
{\an3}分开付
Separate.

660
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:34,510
灯怎么不关的？
Why is this fucking light on?

661
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:38,600
- 祝你生日快乐 - 你们是怎么知道的
- Happy birthday to you - How would you guys know?

662
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:42,370
- 祝你生日快乐 - 我从来不谈我私事的啊
- Happy birthday to you - I never talk about my personal life!

663
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:47,020
祝赛吉生日快乐
Happy birthday, dear Sage

664
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:50,030
祝你生日快乐
Happy birthday to...

665
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,180
- 嗨 丹尼斯 - 嗨 玛茜
- Hi, Dennis. - Mm, hi, Marcie.

666
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:58,200
- 你看起来真开心呀 - 嗯 谢谢
- You look really happy. - Mm, thanks.

667
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,970
- 确实开心 - 好呀 真不错
- I am happy. - That's amazing! Good for you.

668
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:05,540
是的 我周末要去西雅图看场冰球赛
Yeah. I'm going to Seattle this weekend for a hockey game.

669
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:09,170
啊 超羡慕 我超爱冬季运动
Ah, how exciting. I love winter sports.

670
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,820
密歇根人的老毛病啦
It's the Michigan in me.

671
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:12,510
嗯 但冰球太阳刚了
Yeah, it's a bit testosterone-y for my taste,

672
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,780
但罗曼喜欢
but Roman's into it,

673
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,780
感情就得让步嘛
and relationships are about compromise.

674
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,850
喔 罗曼是谁啦？
Ooh! Who's Roman?

675
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:19,500
你男朋友吗？
Is he your boyfriend?

676
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,960
不 我们只是朋友
No. Um, we're just pals.

677
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,550
- 那也挺好的 - 嗯
- That's really nice. - Yeah.

678
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:30,380
- 你结婚了吗？ - 我？哈 哈 哈
- Are you married? - Me?

679
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:33,550
没呢 你以为我结婚了？
No. Um, did you think I was married?

680
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:35,840
嗯 你看上去
Yeah, you just seem like someone

681
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,580
像个会早婚的人
who would be married by your age.

682
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,440
说来巧 我家女人
It's funny you say that, because all the women

683
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,010
结婚都很早
in my family married very young,

684
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:42,310
我一直以为
and I always thought

685

我会在二十八岁前有孩子的
I would have a kid before I turned 28.

现在科技是进步了
And sure, these days, there are advancements,

687
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:49,450
但时间不等人
but the clock is still ticking.

688

卵子还在倒计时啦
For my eggs.

689
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,250
好 等下 我去再添块蛋糕来
Right, well, I'm gonna get more cake.

690
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:57,850
好 我就在这儿等着
Okay. I'll just stand here.

Fuck!

00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:35,670
我们这代人应该是随和的啦
I thought Gen Z was supposed to be nice.

737
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:39,570
冰拿来了
I got ice in a bucket.

738
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:41,010
要我帮你敷敷吗？
Need me to put it anywhere on you?

739
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,990
不用 放酒里就行 你也来一杯
Yeah, my bourbon. I poured you one too.

740
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:51,720
好了
All right.

741
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:53,630
- 干杯 - 干杯
- Cheers. - Cheers.

742
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,760
好
Okay.

743
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:08,440
所以 你在哪儿学的功夫？
So, where'd you learn to beat people up?

744
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:12,240
小时候学过点空手道
I took a little karate as a kid,

745
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:14,910
没拿到蓝带就不学了
but I quit when I didn't make blue belt.

746
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,360
高中后练过点综合格斗
Then I guess I dabbled in some MMA after high school,

747
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:20,860
但其实 打架在课堂上是学不来的
but honestly, you don't learn to fight in a classroom.

748
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,670
得在街头打出来
You learn in the streets.

749
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,400
街头？
In the streets?

750
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:26,960
你到底是什么人啊？
Who are you?

751
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:29,790
那你不生气？
So, you're not mad?

752
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:32,690
我还以为你...
Thought maybe you wouldn't...

753
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:35,580
你会反对暴力什么的
condone violence or something.

754
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:37,970
那是自卫啦
It was self-defense.

755
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,680
前半段算是自卫
For the first half.

756
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:46,540
就算身陷荆棘 也要蹦上一蹦 对吧？
Well, if you're going to hell, keep going. Right?

757
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,450
对
Right.

758
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,510
嘿 可以跟你坦白一件事吗？
Hey, can I confess something to you?

759
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:02,760
我一直在用罗基的健身会员卡
I've been using Rocky's gym membership.

760
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,340
装成他去健身
Pretending I'm him.

761
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:10,800
不太光彩 对吧？
It's kind of fucked up, right?

762
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:13,420
是啊 是挺...
Yeah, that's...

763
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:15,770
不寻常滴
crazy.

764
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,830
前几天在健身房我被人搭讪了
You know, I actually got hit on there the other day.

765
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:22,660
我以为那人认识罗基
I thought maybe the guy knew Rocky, so, uh,

766
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:24,420
就顺着演了
I just went with it.

767
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:25,880
他都说了什么？
What did he say?

768
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:28,650
他说“手臂练得不错嘛”
He was like, "Someone's been working their arms."

769
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:31,840
- 你编的吧 - 他真说了
- He did not say that. - Yeah, he did. Yeah, he...

770
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:34,360
然后我说“是啊
Then I said, uh, "Yeah,

771
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:36,810
我练得挺狠的”
you know, I've been working 'em real good."

772
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:41,780
你真会撩
You're such a tease.

773
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,070
咋了 我只是试试牛刀
What? I experimented.

774
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,630
- 你有牛刀？ - 嗯
- You did? - Mm.

775
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,950
我...
I, uh...

776
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:52,630
有次在派对上吻过一个男的
...kissed a guy at a party once.

777
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:57,450
那时罗基刚出柜不久
It was after Rocky came out.

778
00:47:57,470 --> 00:48:00,240
我是想试着理解罗基
I think I was just trying to understand.

779
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:04,900
这事我从来没给他说过
I never told him that.

780
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:15,010
把当我是罗基 跟我说吧
You could talk to me like I'm Rocky.

781
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:25,760
现在死了吧
Yeah, so you're dead now.

782
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:29,570
谁让你只朝前走 不顾周围的
That's what you get for not looking both ways.

783
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,050
你就知道往前看
You only wanna look forward.

784
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,560
我都不知道该说什么
Sorry, I don't even know what to...

785
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:38,130
我都不记得
I can't even remember the last time

786
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:40,470
我们什么时候真心聊过
we had a real conversation.

787
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:45,480
除了“工作怎样” “妈怎样”那种客套话
That wasn't, "How's work?" You know, "How's Mom?"

788
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:50,440
地球都得围着你转
And it's always on your time too.

789
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:52,790
你最重要 对吧？
Better things to do, right?

790
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:58,020
你直到第二天才祝我生日快乐
You wished me a "happy birthday" the day after.

791
00:48:58,590 --> 00:49:00,610
我知道你不是忘了
And, I mean, I know you didn't forget.

792
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,000
我虽傻 可没傻到那程度
Like, I'm-I'm pretty stupid, but I'm not that fucking stupid.

793
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:08,710
我还特意等到晚上十二点 就怕错过
You know, I actually waited until midnight, just in case,

794
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:12,370
结果 时间一过...
and... and the second it...

795
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:16,210
我当场崩溃
Well, I snapped, 'cause...

796
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:19,700
你太自私了
to be honest, you're so fucking selfish.

797
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,680
你就是不想理我
Like, what, you don't-- you... you don't wanna deal with me?

798
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:28,100
抱歉 我不关心时政
You know, I'm-- I'm sorry I don't read politics,

799
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:31,480
没啥共同话题
or... ...like, or whatever, but, like...

800
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:37,670
知道吗？
You know what?

801
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,980
这都怪你
It's your fucking fault we're like this.

802
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:44,130
你非得走得太快 不顾周围人
Yeah, you couldn't wait to get away. I mean, I would've,

803
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:45,630
我本可跟你去上大学
I would've followed you to college.

804
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:47,940
去日本 我能适应的
I would've gone to Japan. I would've figured it out.

805
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:52,180
可你丫的压根没问过我一次
But you never even fucking asked me!

806
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:56,800
对不起
Sorry.

807
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,220
真对不起
I'm sorry!

808
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:04,800
对不起 我控制不了我的怒气
I'm sorry I can't control my anger.

809
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:11,950
对不起 我在你说喜欢男人时对你发火
And I'm sorry I blew up at you when you told me you like guys.

810
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:16,500
对不起 我还骂你死基佬
I'm sorry I called you a faggot.

811
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:20,700
真希望有后悔药
I wish I could take it back.

812
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,040
我看到你当时的表情
Oh, and your face when I said it,

813
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:24,360
我...
I...

814
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:29,100
我知道那就是你离我而去的原因
I know that's why you left!

815
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:32,920
我只是 只是怕...
I think I was just-- I was scared that...

816
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:35,640
我不知道为什么
I don't... I don't know.

817
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:38,780
我怕 我怕...
If I didn't... if I didn't...

818
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:43,300
我怕我们不一样的话
If you weren't like me, and we weren't the same,

819
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,540
我就找不到自我了

{\an7}【模拟语：游戏《模拟人生》中虚拟语言】

927
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:02,440
{\an1}是一整套语言
It's like it's whole own language.

933

I have a twin brother.

935
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:24,270
{\an1}我们俩着迷得不得了
We were obsessed with it, so we just would play it

936
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:26,090
{\an1}一玩就是好几个小时
for hours together.

937
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:29,680
{\an1}现实里的时间 不是游戏里的那种
Real hours, not Sims hours. Yeah.

938
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:32,160
{\an1}我以为长大后我们会过那种日子
Part of me always thought that's what my life would be like

939
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:33,260
{\an1}就像游戏里那样
when we got older too.

940
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:34,970
{\an1}我和罗基买栋房子

I was always the stay at home twin.

944
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:42,230
{\an1}他去上班 升职加薪
He'd get the job, the promotion,

945
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:45,660
{\an1}而我就收拾屋子 通通马桶
and I'd kind of clean the house, and, you know, fix things,

946
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,240
{\an1}做做饭 什么的
and cook the meals, and...

947
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,930
{\an1}还总把厨房烧了
I'd always burn down the kitchen too.

948
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:53,270
{\an1}他会气得跺脚
Uh, he hated that.

949
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:55,900
你们现在还一起玩吗？
Do you and Rocky still play?

950
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:57,690
不 他...
No, he, uh,

951
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:00,190
他其实几个月前去世了
he passed away a couple months ago, actually.

952
00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:02,350
哦 不
Oh, no.

953
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:05,700
- 真对不起 - 没关系
- I'm so sorry. - Nah, it's okay.

954
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:08,200
反正你又不知道
Um, I mean, you didn't know.

955
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:14,050
我真的很遗憾 抱歉
I'm so sorry.

956
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,630
玛茜 万圣节快...
Marcie! Happy--

957
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:20,530
- 天呐 你还好吗？ - 我没事
- Oh, my God. Are you okay? - I'm fine.

958
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:23,500
喝多了就这样
I'm just an emotional drinker.

959
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,770
雪莉 万圣节快乐
Shelly, happy Halloween.

960
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:27,470
- 万圣节快乐 - 你今晚美翻了
- Happy Halloween! - You look so great.

961
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:29,360
谢啦
Thank you!

962
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:52,830
- 嘿 玛茜 - 嗨 丹尼斯
- Hey, Marcie. - Hi, Dennis.

963
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:55,020
- 派对很棒 - 谢谢你来玩
- Great party. - Yeah. Thanks for coming.

964
00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:56,920
你朋友这么多 真没想到
You have so many friends. Never would've guessed.

965
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:58,550
真的吗？
Really? Huh.

966
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,070
有意思
That's interesting, yeah.

967
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:02,250
同事们对我有固化印象
I mean, everyone at work sees you a certain way,

968
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:04,610
但我其实很外向的
but I'm actually an ENFP personality.

969
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:05,970
我刚入职第一周
Although my first week working here,

970
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:07,380
还在恢复腺热
I was getting over mono,

971
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,740
怕传染人 所以尽量躲着
so I tried to avoid infecting anyone,

972
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,700
可能让人觉得我不好相处
and I think I made a bad impression.

973
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:13,000
- 你怎么会得腺热？ - 我也说不上来
- How'd you get mono? - I don't know.

974
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:15,400
我大学当过宿管 还混过女子社团
But I was an RA in college, and then Kappa Delta,

975
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,100
跟一群女生一起洗澡都家常便饭
so I have no problem sharing a shower with ten other girls.

976
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,390
因此得了腺热？
That's how you got mono?

977
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:20,520
不是啦
No.

978
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:23,100
我想说 我一直都特外向
I'm just saying I've always been an extrovert.

979
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,970
爱热闹
I just love people.

980
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:26,380
不好意思
Oh.

981
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:27,950
前台
Reception.

982
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:29,930
稍等 帮您转接
Let me transfer you.

983
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:32,210
抱歉 我有点絮叨
I'm sorry, you got me babbling.

984
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:33,710
你找我有事吗？
Um, did you need something?

985
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:35,340
还记得我朋友罗曼吗？
Do you remember my friend Roman?

986
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:38,500
天呐 当然记得 我超级...
Oh, my gosh, yes. He is so...

987
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,340
我挺喜欢他的
Um, I really liked him.

988
00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:41,580
嗯 我们在想
Well, we were thinking

989
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,420
哪天喊你一起出来玩
it might be fun to hang out sometime.

990
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:45,770
一起去 结伴去玩那种
Together. Like a double date.

991
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:48,640
我跟罗曼结伴吗？
And Roman would be my designated date?

992
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:50,940
对啊 听不懂吗？
Yes. Was that not clear?

993
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:52,590
天呐
Oh, my gosh! Um...

994
00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:56,090
好啊 我一定来
Yes! I'm so there.

995
00:57:56,490 --> 00:57:58,190
哦 嘿 萨米 近来好吗？
Oh, hey, Sammy. How you doing?

996
00:57:58,210 --> 00:58:01,020
- 嘿 有啥事？ - 没事 没事
- Hey, what's up? - Nothing. Nothing.

997
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,320
周末碰到你挺巧的
It was cool running into you this weekend.

998
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:10,280
对了 你觉得我朋友丹尼斯怎么样？
Uh, hey, what'd you think of my friend Dennis?

999
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:12,910
- 没兴趣 - 哦 好吧
- No. - Okay.

1000
00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:19,750
- 他怎么也来了？ - 我又碰到他了
- What is he doing here? - I ran into him again.

1001
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:21,050
你不是喜欢他吗？
You told me you thought he was attractive.

1002
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:22,380
萨米呢？他很不错的
What happened to Sammy? Sammy was great.

1003
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,650
萨米说你挺萌的
Sammy said that he thought you were cute,

1004
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:24,990
可他不好这口菜
but that he doesn't do cute.

1005
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:26,550
- 我真不行 - 你行的
- I can't do this! - Yes, you can.

1006
00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:28,240
我都替你翻篇了
I explained everything.

1007
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:31,740
伦敦人那事儿别担心
He knows you're not really from London.

1008
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:38,400
我对海鲜过敏
I'm allergic to shellfish,

1009
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:44,350
{\an7}【社交游戏：两真一假 说三件事 猜哪条为假】

1010
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:42,100
我还从滑雪缆车上掉下去过
I once fell off a ski lift...

1011
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:44,360
最后我从没出过国
And I've never been to another country.

1012
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:45,910
缆车假的 谁会从缆车上掉下来啊
Nobody falls off a ski lift.

1013
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:48,240
没出国假的 大家都出过国吧
Everybody's been to another country.

1014
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:50,190
- 我确实去过一次加拿大 - 对吧
- I've been to Canada one time. - Okay.

1015
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:52,320
好吧 我认输
Oh, gosh. Okay, you got me.

1016
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:55,350
等下 你是怎么掉下缆车的？
Wait. Um, so how did you fall off a ski lift?

1017
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:56,950
小时候圣诞节
Uh, we were kids, we took a Christmas trip

1018
00:58:56,970 --> 00:58:59,850
去太阳谷滑雪 罗基掉了手套
to Sun Valley once, and Rocky dropped his glove,

1019
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:02,340
我伸手去捡
and I reached for it and tried to grab it.

1020
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:03,260
然后
Yeah.

1021
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,940
头朝下栽下去了 四五米高
Head first, ten, 15 feet.

1022
00:59:05,970 --> 00:59:08,490
我就记得手腕咔嚓一声
Uh, I remember just hearing this snap in my wrist.

1023
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,260
- 天呐 - 嗯
- Jesus. - Yeah.

1024
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,680
- 我超爱滑雪滴 - 不会吧 你也喜欢？
- I love skiing. - Oh, no way. You like skiing?

1025
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:13,830
是啊是啊 我会滑雪
Yeah, yeah. I-I ski.

1026
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:15,470
- 我可是密歇根人 - 不错
- Um, I'm from Michigan. - That's cool.

1027
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:16,970
- 你居然没口音 - 好了 该我了
- You don't even have an accent. - Okay, my turn.

1028
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:20,200
我不会吹口哨 我还把我的猫小面
I can't whistle, I once traded my cat Noodles

1029
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:22,880
换成邻居的限量版豆豆娃玩偶
for my neighbor's Princess Diana Beanie Baby.

1030
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:24,450
几个小时后就改主意了
The deal was revoked hours later.

1031
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:27,620
还有 我想下 我想下
And what else, what else? Um, oh.

1032
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:30,550
我去过真人秀《真实世界》的海选
I auditioned for The Real World...

1033
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:32,390
那是大学时候
...San Diego when I was in college.

1034
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:36,020
第二个细节太多 不像假的
Mm, your second one is too specific to be a lie.

1035
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,830
假的是 你根本没去过《真实世界》的海选
And you didn't audition for Real World.

1036
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:40,690
对啊 你在最后那句前犹豫了
Yeah, you hesitated before that last one.

1037
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:43,030
- 我也猜那是假的 - 对
- I think that's... that's probably the lie. - Yeah.

1038
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:46,540
口哨假的 你会吹口哨 对吧？
I think you can whistle, right?

1039
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,470
- 我从没养过猫 - 天呐
- I've never had a cat. - Oh, my God!

1040
00:59:48,490 --> 00:59:50,340
- 真的？ - 你太会玩了
- What? - You are so good at this.

1041
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,210
对啊 诀窍在于
Yeah. Well, the trick is to say something

1042
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:57,010
情感上让人信服 但事实不一定是真的
that is emotionally true but factually false.

1043
00:59:58,270 --> 01:00:00,650
- 是啊 - 好的 该我了
- Yeah. - Okay, my turn.

1044
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:02,180
我十岁那年
Uh, when I was ten,

1045
01:00:02,210 --> 01:00:05,510
跳水出了事故 差点少了颗蛋蛋
I almost lost a testicle in a diving board accident...

1046
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:23,310
说真的 我以前总觉得
You know, I used to feel...

1047
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:30,250
我不想说自己比单胎更优越 不过
I don't wanna say "superior" to singletons, but...

1048
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:35,300
我觉得他们怪可怜的
Yeah, like, I felt bad for them.

1049
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:39,120
可现在我跟他们没两样了
And now, I'm just like everybody else.

1050
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:40,950
甚至更惨
Except worse.

1051
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:45,520
因为我目光跟别人不一样
Because I know.

1052
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:49,640
走到哪儿 眼睛都被迫去注意双胞胎
I see twins everywhere I go.

1053
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:51,700
酒吧 公园 到处都看得到
My bar, my park.

1054
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:53,720
害得我把常去的果饮店换了
I had to switch juiceries,

1055
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,770
因为那家收银是一对双胞胎
because my go-to hired twin cashiers.

1056
01:00:56,790 --> 01:00:58,010
- 嗨 二位 - 嘿
- Hi, boys. - Hey.

1057
01:00:58,030 --> 01:00:59,470
- 早上好嘛 - 早啊
- And good morning. - Morning.

1058
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:01,080
我偷偷带进来的
I snuck it past security.

1059
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:03,910
- 天呐 你真坏 - 没有啦
- My God, you're so naughty. - No, I didn't.

1060
01:01:03,930 --> 01:01:06,050
- 我礼貌地请求带进来 - 哦
- I just asked really politely. - Oh.

1061
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:07,500
我本来也想给你带一杯
I would've brought you one, but Roman says

1062
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,260
但罗曼说你不喝咖啡
you don't drink coffee.

1063
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:12,310
对 咖啡对牙齿不好 我喝茶
Yeah, coffee's bad for your teeth. I drink tea.

1064
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:14,490
其实茶里的单宁
You know, tea actually contains

1065
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:16,160
比咖啡更多
a higher tannin content than coffee,

1066
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:18,230
更容易把牙染黄
so it's more likely to stain your teeth.

1067
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:19,850
- 冷知识啊 - 我真不知道
- Interesting fact! - I didn't know that.

1068
01:01:19,870 --> 01:01:22,600
- 嗯 - 其实星巴克也卖茶
- Yeah. - Starbucks sells tea, FYI.

1069
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:24,830
哦 里面是自煮的咖啡
Oh, I brew my own coffee.

1070
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:27,680
只是用星巴克的杯子 喜欢这杯子
I just really like their travel mugs.

1071
01:01:29,810 --> 01:01:31,740
- 你今天真好看 - 谢谢 宝贝
- You look really cute today. - Thanks, baby.

1072
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:01,870
对了 丹尼斯
Oh, Dennis.

1073
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:03,570
我昨天在健身房看到一对双胞胎
I saw a pair of twins at the gym yesterday,

1074
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:06,140
回家路上又碰到一对
and then I saw another pair of twins on my walk home.

1075
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,040
感觉他们无处不在
It's like they're everywhere.

1076
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:10,310
- 那叫频率错觉 - 啥？
- That's the frequency illusion. - What?

1077
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:12,600
又叫巴德-迈因霍夫现象
Also known as the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon.

1078
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:17,060
{\an9}【巴德-迈因霍夫现象(频率错觉)：一旦注意就觉得无处不在】

1079
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:14,780
就像我买了辆丰田普瑞斯
It's like when I got my navy blue Prius.

1080
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,120
望眼路上全是普瑞斯
Suddenly, I was seeing navy blue Prii everywhere,

1081
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:19,390
其实一直都有 只是以前没注意过
but they'd always been there, I just wasn't paying attention.

1082
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:22,190
你今天真聪明 我是说 你本来就很聪明
You are so smart today. I mean, you're smart every day,

1083
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:23,790
- 但今天尤其明显 - 哈 别这样
- but especially today. - No!

1084
01:02:23,810 --> 01:02:25,230
我当年读心理学的
I was a psychology major.

1085
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:27,400
怪不得现在当前台
That explains why you're a receptionist.

1086
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:29,770
毕竟最会哄人
'Cause you're so good with people.

1087
01:02:29,790 --> 01:02:31,140
多谢 丹尼斯
Thanks, Dennis.

1088
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:34,980
让我想起我和丹尼斯在小组里的谈话
Anyway, it reminded me of the discussion we had in group.

1089
01:02:35,010 --> 01:02:36,240
什么小组？
What group?

1090
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:38,800
我老提的双胞胎丧亲互助会
The support group I'm always talking about.

1091
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:41,190
什么 丹尼斯也有双胞胎？
Wait, does Dennis have a twin?

1092
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:44,180
有啊 我俩就是在那里认识的 我记得我说过
Yeah, that's how we met. I thought I told you this.

1093
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,850
没有啊 我不记...
No, I...

1094
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:47,760
丹尼斯 你不是说你是独生子吗
Dennis, you told me you were an only child.

1095
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:49,420
- 我可没说过 - 你说过 就说过
- Mm, I didn't tell you that. - Yeah, yeah!

1096
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,850
那天是公司小聚
It was bagel Friday.

1097
01:02:50,870 --> 01:02:52,820
我清楚记得 因为我也是独生子
I remember, because I'm an only child too,

1098
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,520
而且我们都是狮子座
and-and we're both Leos.

1099
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:57,280
嗯 我双胞胎丹恩走了
Well, I am an only child now,

1100
01:02:57,310 --> 01:02:59,000
现在是独生子了
because my twin, Dean, died,

1101
01:02:59,020 --> 01:02:59,990
这很私人
and it's very personal,

1102
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:02,580
没想过要告诉你
so I guess I didn't feel comfortable telling you that.

1103
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:05,100
- 真抱歉 - 没关系
- I'm so sorry. - It's fine.

1104
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:07,760
没事的
It's okay.

1105
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:09,910
我真笨
You know, I feel like such a doofus,

1106
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:11,870
有一次在公司
because there was that one time at work

1107
01:03:11,890 --> 01:03:14,230
几个月前吧 我本来不想多问
a couple of months ago, and I didn't want to pry,

1108
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:16,420
你当时好伤心
but you were so sad,

1109
01:03:16,450 --> 01:03:18,640
说话都结结巴巴
and-and you were kind of hard to understand,

1110
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:20,050
我记得你说
but you were saying something about

1111
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:22,080
你最爱的人 好像被车给...
how the love of your life had been hit by a--

1112
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:25,640
不 闭嘴
No! Stop!

1113
01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:27,190
- 丹尼斯？ - 你没事吧？
- Dennis? - You okay, man?

1114
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:29,820
我 我得走 我有 有幽闭恐惧
Uh, I-I need to get out of here! I'm-I'm claustrophobic,

1115
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:32,020
我不想再提丹恩了
and I don't wanna talk about Dean!

1116
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:33,940
我觉得他是在发焦虑症
I think he's having an anxiety attack.

1117
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:36,610
对 我 我在焦虑发作
Yes! I-I'm having an anxiety attack!

1118
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:40,760
我不行了 我不行了
Anxiety attack! Anxiety attack!

1119
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:51,300
我问过这儿经理了
So, I spoke with Sharon, the manager--

1120
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:52,920
哦 莎伦她人真好
Oh, she's a sweetheart.

1121
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:54,980
你们要代金券 还是要退款？
Do we want credit or a refund?

1122
01:03:55,070 --> 01:03:56,920
{\an1}代金券
Credit.

1123
01:03:55,070 --> 01:03:56,920
{\an3}退款
Refund.

1124
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:01,760
乔尼死了
Jonny died.

1125
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:04,010
我的狗乔尼
My dog.

1126
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:08,020
我不该用我哥的名字给它取名
I shouldn't have named him after my brother.

1127
01:04:08,350 --> 01:04:11,440
感觉我哥又死了一遍
It's like he's gone all over again.

1128
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:16,170
真正的乔尼死后
After... Jonny died, the real Jonny,

1129
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:19,910
我就死死贴着我老婆不放
I became glued to my wife.

1130
01:04:19,930 --> 01:04:24,610
她说我是在用她顶替我哥哥
She said I was trying to replace my brother...

1131
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:46,600
- 是丹尼斯 - 你还是接吧
- Dennis. - Maybe you should get it.

1132
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:49,140
都打第三遍了 说不定真有急事
It's the third time. It could be an emergency!

1133
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:52,490
天呐 要命
Oh, my God. Shit.

1134

Oh, right, Marcie. So needy.

1138

So, what's up?

1140
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:11,980
{\an3}没什么 就想问问你们在干嘛
Just wanted to see what you were doing.

1141
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:14,290

I'll be here, alone, again.

1146
01:05:26,930 --> 01:05:29,240
{\an3}别担心我 早习惯了
I mean, don't worry about me. I'm used to it.

1147
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:30,650
{\an3}总能找点事做
I'm sure I'll find something to do.

1148
01:05:30,670 --> 01:05:32,210
{\an3}你知道的
You know, I've got that whole

1149
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:35,600
{\an3}我有一堆没翻的书可以看看
unread collection of books I like to look at.

1150
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:38,430
{\an1}丹尼斯 别挂 等我一下
Dennis, hang on. I'm just gonna put you on hold for a second.

Hey, buddy, sorry that took so long. Um,

1154

how'd you like to spend Christmas in Moscow?

1155
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:57,260
{\an3}爱达荷州的莫斯科？
Moscow, Idaho?

1156
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:59,020
{\an1}没错
That's the one.

1157
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:03,430
{\an7}♪ 车窗摇 话随风拂
<i>♪ She rolls the window down ♪</i>

1158
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:08,130

<i>♪ And she talks over the sound ♪</i>

1159
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:08,680
丹尼斯 你后排坐得舒服吗？
Do you have enough leg room, Dennis?

1160
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:09,890
不舒服
No.

1161

1162
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:15,860
- 装饰呢？ - 什么？你说啥？
- Where are the decorations? - I'm sorry, what?

1163
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,850
圣诞装饰啊？灯呢？一点节日气氛都没有吗？
Decorations? Where are the lights? Anything? Christmas?

1164
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:20,040
什么装饰？你在胡说什么？
Where are the decorations? What are you talking about?

1165
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:22,490
- 你连棵圣诞树都没买？ - 对 我就没买
- Did you not even get a tree? - No, I didn't get a tree.

1166
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:24,730
你怎么不找人来给我布置？
Why don't we call the fucking butler?

1167
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:26,570
过个节 连棵树都没有
It's the holiday! Why wouldn't you get a tree?

1168
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:28,290
别跟我吵 拜托 别跟我吵
Don't start with me. Please, don't start with me.

1169
01:06:28,310 --> 01:06:29,480
你知道我怎么想吗？
You know what I think about it?

1170
01:06:29,510 --> 01:06:31,040
你怎么不把树带来？
It's fine. Why didn't you bring a tree?

1171
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:33,070
- 我要扛棵树来？ - 你不该做的吗？
- I'm supposed to lug a tree? - Whose job is it?

1172
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:34,650
- 不 - 你就是自私
- No! - It's selfish! Yes, it is!

1173
01:06:34,670 --> 01:06:37,030
别这样说我 你凭什么这样说我？
Don't say that to me! How can you say that to me?

1174
01:06:37,050 --> 01:06:38,820
因为这就是该死的事实
Because it's the fucking truth!

1175
01:06:38,850 --> 01:06:41,360
这根本不是他想要的 绝对不是
It's not what he wanted! It's not fucking what he wanted!

1176
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:42,950
别一副全懂的样子
You don't know that. You don't know everything.

1177
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:45,120
我当然知道 所有认识他的人都清楚
Yes, I do! Everybody who fucking knew him knew that!

1178
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:46,360
少摆出一副全懂的样子
You don't know everything.

1179
01:06:46,390 --> 01:06:47,590
晚饭要不要开瓶酒？
Do you guys want wine with dinner?

1180
01:06:47,610 --> 01:06:49,550
- 可以啊 - 好的 谢谢
- Wine's good. - Yes, thank you.

1181
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:53,080
爱达荷州 都十年没在这儿住了
Idaho... Hasn't even fucking lived here for ten years!

1182
01:06:55,690 --> 01:06:58,760
我刚才是不是太过分？
Do you think I was being too mean?

1183
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:03,370
我觉得 你们俩其实都还没走出来
I think you're both grieving.

1184
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,950
没事的
it's all right.

1185
01:07:06,810 --> 01:07:10,870
- 圣诞节还是能补救的 - 有什么意义？
- We can still save Christmas. - What's the point?

1186
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:14,870
就算身陷荆棘 也要蹦上一蹦
If you're going to hell, keep going.

1187
01:07:14,890 --> 01:07:17,150
- “砥砺前行” - 什么？
- "Through hell." - Hmm?

1188
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:20,590
“就算身陷荆棘 也要砥砺前行”
"If you're going through hell, keep going."

1189
01:07:20,610 --> 01:07:23,300
因为撑下去就会天晴
Because it gets better.

1190
01:07:23,350 --> 01:07:25,630
这是丘吉尔的名言
It's a Winston Churchill quote.

1191
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,230
哦
Oh.

1192
01:07:27,730 --> 01:07:30,810
原来如此 这通顺了
Yeah, that makes way more sense.

1193
01:07:31,890 --> 01:07:33,090
我也知道这名言
I knew that too.

1194
01:07:35,090 --> 01:07:36,150
好
Nice, buddy.

1195
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:40,510

01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,290
下一个谁来？
Who's next?

1201
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:03,620
这卡是给你的 玛茜
the card's for you, Marcie.

1202
01:08:07,410 --> 01:08:10,050
画着考拉 我超爱考拉
Oh, it's a koala! I love koalas.

1203
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:12,890
“圣诞快乐 丹尼斯敬上”
"Merry Christmas. Dennis."

1204
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:16,840
天呐 居然是橄榄园礼品卡
Oh, God. A gift card to the Olive Garden.

1205
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:18,410
我爱死那家了
I freaking love the Olive Garden.

1206
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:20,060
你怎么想到的？
How did you know?

1207
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:21,490
直觉吧
I just had a feeling.

1208
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:24,710
我超爱他们家托斯卡纳汤
I am obsessed with their Toscana soup.

1209
01:08:25,390 --> 01:08:26,370
谢谢你
Thank you.

1210
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,200

All right, babe, all right.

1211
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:29,240
好了
All right.

1212
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:32,960
丹尼斯 这是你的
And, Dennis, this one's for you.

1213
01:08:34,550 --> 01:08:36,450
是本书
It's a book.

1214
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:58,410
我想请你帮我重新设计下封面
I thought you could, uh, redesign the cover for me.

1215
01:08:59,190 --> 01:09:01,590
《爱心树》我最喜欢这本书
It's The Giving Tree. It's my favorite book.

1216
01:08:59,190 --> 01:09:04,600
{\an9}【《爱心树》：谢尔·希尔弗斯坦(美)所著 讲付出被掏空的单向关系】

1217
01:09:01,610 --> 01:09:04,600
还是我唯一读过两遍的书
It's the only one I've ever read twice.

1218
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:08,700
这封面太经典了
It's an iconic cover.

1219
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:08,700
{\an9}【封面：大树向男孩递苹果的简单线描】

1220
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:10,950
你能行的 我看好你
Yeah, well, I believe in you.

1221
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:14,010
等等 你这是在给丹尼斯留作业吗？
I don't get it. Um, why are you giving Dennis homework?

1222
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:16,390
不是 他的梦想是做封面设计师
It's his, uh, dream to be a book designer.

1223
01:09:16,410 --> 01:09:17,980
- 真的吗？太棒了 - 是啊
- Really? That's neat. - Yeah.

1224
01:09:18,010 --> 01:09:19,680
我还真不知道
I didn't know.

1225
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,710
我以为你想当律师
I thought you wanted to be a lawyer.

1226
01:09:21,730 --> 01:09:23,830
不 我讨厌律师
No, I hate lawyers.

1227
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:27,380
那你干嘛准备律师考试？
Then why were you studying for the LSAT?

1228
01:09:28,770 --> 01:09:30,820
图个乐子
For fun.

1229
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,960
你都讨厌律师了 哪来的乐趣？
Oh, why would that be fun if you hate lawyers?

1230
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:36,390
我哪知道 为什么有人玩极限运动？
I don't know, Marcie. Why do people walk on hot coals?

1231
01:09:36,410 --> 01:09:38,700
就为了炫耀 我做过
So they can say they did.

1232
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:45,910
- 圣诞快乐 - 圣诞快乐
- Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.

1233
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:49,750
丹尼斯的双胞胎是什么时候去世的吗？
Do you know when Dennis's twin died?

1234
01:09:49,770 --> 01:09:50,900
丹恩？
Dean?

1235
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:55,490
嗯 应该是一年前吧 也可能是一年半前
Um, I think a year ago, year and a half maybe.

1236
01:09:55,810 --> 01:09:58,030
他是住在波特兰吗？
Did he live in Portland?

1237
01:09:58,230 --> 01:10:00,020
丹尼斯说他在国税局上班
Dennis said he worked for the IRS.

1238
01:10:00,050 --> 01:10:01,580
国税局在波特兰有分部吗？
Is the IRS in Portland?

1239
01:10:01,610 --> 01:10:04,290
- 宝贝 国税局全国都有 - 哦
- Oh, the IRS is everywhere, baby. - Oh.

1240
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,960
- 为什么要问这个？ - 没什么
- Why do you ask? - No reason.

1241
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:20,450
- 他去哪了？ - 天呐
- Where is he? - Oh, my God.

1242
01:10:20,890 --> 01:10:24,060
他们去爬山了 说天黑就回来
They went hiking. They said they'd be back after sunset.

1243
01:10:29,770 --> 01:10:32,540
你喜欢宝可梦吗？
You like Pokémon?

1244
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:35,130
嗯 喜欢
Yeah. I like Pokémon.

1245
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:37,820
罗基和罗曼小时候迷死了那些卡片
Rocky and Roman loved those cards.

1246
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,570
整天就聊这个
All they could talk about.

1247
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,400
花了我好多钱
I spent so much fucking money on them.

1248
01:10:43,210 --> 01:10:45,050
后来罗基一走了之
And then Rocky just left.

1249
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:47,800
东西都扔这儿不管
He couldn't be bothered to take his shit with him.

1250
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:52,790
我这房子成了他的仓库
I'm like a storage unit.

1251
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:55,700
你要不要拿去？
Do you want 'em?

1252
01:10:56,690 --> 01:11:00,730
你不想留的话 我可以拿走
Yeah, I-- If you don't want them, I can take them.

1253
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:08,110
罗曼说你也失去了双胞胎
Roman said you lost a twin.

1254
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:10,760
我 呃...
I, uh...

1255
01:11:12,550 --> 01:11:14,230
是的
did, yes.

1256
01:11:17,410 --> 01:11:20,330
那你就懂被分割...
So you know what it feels like.

1257
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:23,580
被撕裂的感觉了
To be split.

1258
01:11:24,770 --> 01:11:26,090
嗯
Hmm.

1259
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:33,750
他现在根本不跟我说话
He doesn't talk to me.

1260
01:11:35,690 --> 01:11:39,210
人家都说丧子最痛
They say there's nothing worse than losing a child.

1261
01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:46,590
或许更难受的是被疏远
But maybe there is.

1262
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:54,520
他能有你这个知己 我也算放心了
I'm glad he has someone who understands.

1263
01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:19,450
我下班了 你忙完别急着走
I'm heading out. Before you leave,

1264
01:12:19,470 --> 01:12:22,230
玛茜在会议室等着见你
Marcie wants to see you in the conference room.

1265
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:24,190
- 干嘛？ - 我没问
- Why? - I didn't ask.

1266
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:26,490
好吧 音乐会玩得开心
Okay. Have fun at the concert.

1267
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:28,130
谢谢
Thanks.

1268
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:32,770
我跟你说过要去音乐会吗？
Did I tell you I was going to a concert?

1269
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:34,620
说过
Yes.

1270
01:12:52,210 --> 01:12:54,740
谢谢你肯来见我
Thank you for agreeing to meet with me.

1271
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:58,370
我需要和你谈谈 丹尼斯
I need to talk to you, Dennis.

1272
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,530
我还有事 先走了
Okay, well, I have somewhere I have to be.

1273
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:05,400
你其实没有双胞胎 对吧？
You don't really have a twin, do you?

1274
01:13:05,950 --> 01:13:08,040
罗曼说 丹恩去世大约
Roman mentioned that Dean passed away,

1275
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:09,170
一年半了
like, a year and a half ago

1276
01:13:09,190 --> 01:13:10,710
可这完全说不通
and that didn't make sense

1277
01:13:10,730 --> 01:13:12,310
因为我认识你更早了
because I knew you, like, a year and a half ago

1278
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:13,470
按理说我该知道的
and I should've known that.

1279
01:13:13,490 --> 01:13:15,810
你的社交媒体根本没有双胞胎照片
And you don't have photos of him on Instagram,

1280
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:17,950
我觉得不对劲
and I thought, "Well, that's strange,

1281
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:20,870
当时我想你可能删了
but maybe he deleted them."

1282
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:24,520
我昨天问了国税局朋友雪莉
So, yesterday, I texted my friend Sheri at the IRS,

1283
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:26,980
她说查不到丹恩·本弗这个人
and she said there was no Dean Benver in their records.

1284
01:13:27,010 --> 01:13:28,660
昨晚我还打电话给凯文·罗斯
And then last night, I called Kevin Ross,

1285
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:30,120
就是你高中同学
who I saw you went to high school with.

1286
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:31,850
我在油画课上认识的
I met him in an oil painting class,

1287
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:33,320
他说你根本没兄弟
and he said you didn't have a brother,

1288
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:34,560
他很确定
and he's 100 percent sure,

1289
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:36,600
你在学校吃饭总一个人
because you sat alone at lunch every day,

1290
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:38,140
他妈还硬让他去参加你生日
and his mom made him go to your birthday party

1291
01:13:38,170 --> 01:13:39,550
结果就他一个人去了
and no one else showed up, and you have

1292
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:41,020
你只有一张单人床
a twin bed but just one,

1293
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:43,300
他意思你还在那床上胡搞过
and he also made it sound like you fooled around in it

1294
01:13:43,330 --> 01:13:45,130
我不确定 他老婆在背景吵着
but I couldn't be sure cause I heard his wife in the background...

1295
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:46,830
你凭什么查我？
Why are you spying on me?

1296
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:49,560
你是不是认识罗曼的哥哥罗基？
Did you know Roman's brother Rocky?

1297
01:13:49,580 --> 01:13:52,420
- 不 - 我不信你
- No. - I don't believe you.

1298
01:13:54,370 --> 01:13:55,750
别再纠缠了
Let it go.

1299
01:13:55,770 --> 01:13:57,550
罗曼和你一样失去双胞胎
Roman thinks you met

1300
01:13:57,570 --> 01:13:59,420
才和你走到一起的
because you lost a twin.

1301
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,920
而你的双胞胎根本不存在
A twin that doesn't even exist.

1302
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:03,520
你不能这样骗他
You can't keep this from him, Dennis.

1303
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:05,150
他必须知道真相
He has to know the truth.

1304
01:14:05,170 --> 01:14:07,060
等我准备好会告诉他的
I will tell him when I'm ready.

1305
01:14:07,090 --> 01:14:08,830
现在就得说 不然我就说
You need to tell him now or I will.

1306
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:10,520
不许你说
You're not telling him, Marcie.

1307
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:12,020
你看 你什么都有
I mean, God, you have everything.

1308
01:14:12,050 --> 01:14:13,830
人缘好 朋友多
Everybody likes you, you have a million friends,

1309
01:14:13,850 --> 01:14:15,230
父母还都在
you have both your parents.

1310
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:18,340
估计连养个绿植都不死
I bet none of your houseplants ever fucking die.

1311
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:20,810
给我留点儿 行不行？
Let me have one good thing.

1312
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:22,890
我在帮他 我满足 他也满足
I'm happy. He's happy. I help him.

1313
01:14:22,910 --> 01:14:24,800
凌晨三点他需要人倾诉时
When he needed somebody to talk to at 3:00 in the morning

1314
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:25,830
接电话的是我
I'm the one who picked up the phone.

1315
01:14:25,860 --> 01:14:27,520
那时候你死哪儿呢？
Where the fuck were you then, huh?

1316
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:31,300
要不是我 你根本不会跟罗曼扯上关系
You wouldn't even know Roman if it wasn't for me.

1317
01:14:33,050 --> 01:14:35,510
你想让我怎么办
What do you expect me to do?

1318
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:44,650
我知道早晚得告诉他 只是...
I know I need to tell him. I just...

1319
01:14:45,470 --> 01:14:48,320
我需要多一点时间
I want a little bit more time.

1320
01:14:48,890 --> 01:14:50,290
求你了
Please.

1321
01:15:26,290 --> 01:15:28,820
她说这个周末见不了我
She said she couldn't see me this weekend.

1322
01:15:29,410 --> 01:15:31,120
还不停道歉
Then she kept apologizing

1323
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:33,810
还说让我找你聊聊
and said that I should talk to you.

1324
01:15:34,470 --> 01:15:37,230
你确定她什么都没说？
I mean, are you sure she didn't say anything?

1325
01:15:38,150 --> 01:15:39,720
哦 我竟然忘了
Oh, you know what? I totally forgot

1326
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:43,660
公司在搞多发性硬化症的募捐活动
we're doing this company-wide fundraiser for MS research,

1327
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:46,050
玛茜得守口如瓶
and Marcie took a vow of silence.

1328
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:47,880
- 真的吗？ - 嗯
- Really? - Hmm.

1329
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:50,800
为什么她不直接说明原因？
Why wouldn't she just tell me that?

1330
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:53,380
因为我们都签了保密协议
We had to sign nondisclosure agreements.

1331
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:54,840
原来如此
Oh.

1332
01:15:56,020 --> 01:15:56,990
好吧
Okay.

1333
01:15:58,350 --> 01:15:59,870
“抱歉 没接到
Oops. I guess I missed you.

1334
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:02,010
“我保证会尽快回电
I promise to call you back ASAP.

1335
01:16:02,030 --> 01:16:03,620
“祝你生活愉快”
I hope you're having a wonderful day.

1336
01:16:04,570 --> 01:16:06,670
嘿 是我
Hey, it's me.

1337
01:16:06,830 --> 01:16:09,430
我知道你忙着救人
Just, uh... I know you can't talk

1338
01:16:09,450 --> 01:16:11,960
没法接电话
'cause you're saving lives.

1339
01:16:19,910 --> 01:16:21,720
罗曼？
Roman?

1340
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:24,850
小曼曼
Roman.

1341
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:26,250
嘿
Hey.

1342
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:28,490
谁把酒瓶拧开了
Someone cracked the bourbon.

1343
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:30,000
嗯 哦
Mm, ooh.

1344
01:16:30,630 --> 01:16:34,070
我先喝了 等你太无聊了
Well, I started without you 'cause I was bored.

1345
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:35,310
我去冲个澡
I'm gonna hop in the shower.

1346
01:16:35,330 --> 01:16:36,510
别走
No, don't.

1347
01:16:36,530 --> 01:16:39,630
你已经离开我很久了
You already left me alone for so long.

1348
01:16:39,950 --> 01:16:41,420
天呐 你喝大了
Oh, wow, you are drunk.

1349
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:42,740
天大
Wow.

1350
01:16:43,370 --> 01:16:44,800
来
Uh, here.

1351
01:16:44,830 --> 01:16:47,260
我给你倒了杯
I poured you one.

1352
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:50,420
没往里下药
I didn't put anything in it.

1353
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:51,630
不过也说不定
I could've though.

1354
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:53,690
你根本不了解我
You never know. You don't know me.

1355
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,070
谢了
Thanks.

1356
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:05,600
这鞋把我磨得要命
God, these fucking shoes are killing me.

1357
01:17:05,630 --> 01:17:08,000
这鞋真紧
I think my feet got bigger.

1358
01:17:08,030 --> 01:17:10,460
知道意味着什么吗？
Well, you know what that means.

1359
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:13,560
- 什么？ - 没什么
- What? - Nothing.

1360
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,050
要不要我给你捏捏脚？
Do you want a foot massage?

1361
01:17:15,070 --> 01:17:17,350
- 不用 我没事 - 你确定？
- Uh, nah, I'm okay. - Are you sure?

1362
01:17:17,370 --> 01:17:19,090
我手艺可是一流的
I'm super good.

1363
01:17:19,110 --> 01:17:24,250
大学暑假的时候 我还特地去学过按摩
I went to massage training school in college in the summer.

1364
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:27,380
- 行吧 - 好
- Okay. - Yeah.

1365
01:17:27,930 --> 01:17:29,730
也许有点用
Maybe it'll help.

1366
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:31,260
肯定有用
Yeah, I bet it will.

1367
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:33,970
过来吧
Come on over.

1368
01:17:34,510 --> 01:17:37,470
客官请上床
The bed is fine.

1369
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:44,530
- 这样躺吗？ - 嗯 对
- Just like this? - Yeah.

1370
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:48,000
不好意思 我脚肯定臭得要命
Sorry, man. I bet my foot smells like death.

1371
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:49,860
没关系
I don't mind.

1372
01:17:53,070 --> 01:17:54,710
噢 哇哦
Oh, wow.

1373

天呐 你还真挺专业的
Oh, shit, you are good at that.

1374
01:17:59,210 --> 01:18:01,980
别管了 你喝你的酒就行
Just drink your drink.

1375
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:05,900
别急 心急吃不了臭豆腐
All right, hold your hippos.

1376
01:18:07,310 --> 01:18:09,350
你说什么？
What did you say?

1377
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:13,010
我说“心急吃不了臭豆腐”
"Hold your hippos." It's like, uh...

1378
01:18:13,030 --> 01:18:15,630
相当于“心急吃不了热豆腐”
it's like "hold your horses," but...

1379
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:18,300
这是我和罗基的内梗
It's just something Rocky and I say.

1380
01:18:18,330 --> 01:18:19,300
哦
Oh.

1381
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:25,090
你和丹恩也有这种专属俚语吧？
Did you and Dean ever have anything like that?

1382
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:26,520
呃
Um...

1383
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:31,620
“真是心有灵犀啊”
"Jinx, you owe me a soda."

1384
01:18:31,730 --> 01:18:34,080
嗯 但谁不会说这句啊
Right, but everyone says that.

1385
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:39,160
算我们先发明的
Well, we started it. Yeah.

1386
01:18:45,190 --> 01:18:48,480
哦 对对对 就是那儿
Oh, yeah. That's the fucking spot.

1387
01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:54,550
哇 太爽了
Ooh. Wow. That's really good.

1388
01:19:00,580 --> 01:19:04,590
这还真挺管用的
This is actually really helping.

1389
01:19:23,910 --> 01:19:26,480
你干嘛呢？
What are you doing?

1390
01:19:26,570 --> 01:19:28,940
哦 你搞什么鬼？
What the fuck was that?!

1391
01:19:29,070 --> 01:19:32,640
对不起 我不是故意的
I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do that!

1392
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,190
哪个按摩课会教这个啊
I don't know if they teach that in massage school...

1393
01:19:35,210 --> 01:19:38,380
不管怎样 我没兴趣 别捏了
but I gotta say—uh, I'm not into that, so...

1394
01:19:40,170 --> 01:19:41,860
对不起 只是...
I'm sorry. It's just...

1395
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:44,620
只是 你太像他了
You look so much like him.

1396
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:45,870
像谁？
Like who?

1397
01:19:45,890 --> 01:19:48,080
我不想让你恨我
Oh, I don't want you to hate me.

1398
01:19:48,110 --> 01:19:49,870
我不恨你 没事的
I don't hate you. It's not a big deal, okay?

1399
01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:52,320
只是 别再干这种事了
Just... don't do that again.

1400
01:19:52,350 --> 01:19:54,770
只要我说出真相 你一定会恨我
Yeah... but if I tell you the truth, you're gonna hate me.

1401
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,730
然后一切就都完了
And then it's all gonna be over.

1402
01:19:56,760 --> 01:20:00,800
你胡说什么？我怎么会恨你
What are you talking about? Why—why would I hate you?

1403
01:20:01,570 --> 01:20:03,960
因为...
Because, um...

1404
01:20:04,130 --> 01:20:07,920
我就没双胞胎 丹恩是我编的
I don't have a twin, and Dean isn't real.

1405
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:09,150
什...
Wha--

1406
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:13,360
什么？你编的是什么意思？
What do you mean? What do you mean he isn't real?

1407
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:17,580
是我瞎编的 根本没有丹恩这个人
I made him up. He doesn't exist.

1408
01:20:18,490 --> 01:20:20,690
你在放什么屁
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:20:20,970 --> 01:20:23,460
你为啥还去互助会？
Why are you in the support group?

01:20:23,490 --> 01:20:25,370
我只是跟着你
I just started following you.

1411
01:20:25,390 --> 01:20:28,480
机缘巧合就进去了 我一直想坦白
I thought it was a sign, and I kept trying to tell you,

1412
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:31,050
可 可怎么开口呢
but I-- I mean, how do you say...

1413
01:20:31,070 --> 01:20:32,950
我爱上了你哥
Oh, I was in love with your brother.

1414
01:20:32,970 --> 01:20:34,720
一夜情 算不上爱
Except it wasn't really love because I only knew him for a day

1415
01:20:34,740 --> 01:20:36,750
但对我来说就是全部
but at the time, that felt like enough, and...

1416
01:20:36,770 --> 01:20:39,490
我就是那个路口的疯子
And I was the crazy guy in-in the intersection,

1417
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:41,260
按理来说我无责
and, you know, it wasn't technically my fault,

1418
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:42,970
可要不是我 他可能还活着
but if he never met me, he'd probably still be alive,

1419
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,550
那天毁了我
and it was the worst day of my life and...

1420
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:46,490
我也不知道为啥一直编下去
I don't know why I kept lying.

1421
01:20:46,510 --> 01:20:48,560
我只 只想和你亲近
I just... I wanted to be close to you,

1422
01:20:48,580 --> 01:20:49,790
想着能弥补
and I thought I could make it better,

1423
01:20:49,820 --> 01:20:51,230
结果越弄越糟

打扰一下 能帮我们拍张照吗？
Excuse me. Can you take a picture of us?

1489
01:25:52,390 --> 01:25:55,770
不 没门 你们俩哪用得着我
No. No, I can't. You have no idea how lucky you are.

1490
01:25:55,790 --> 01:25:57,890
抱歉 打扰你了
Well, sorry we asked.

靠
Fuck.

1494
01:26:14,220 --> 01:26:15,790
你在找什么？
What are you looking for?

1495
01:26:15,810 --> 01:26:19,130
我怎么都找不到罗基的毛衣
I can't find Rocky's sweater. Uh...

1496
01:26:19,350 --> 01:26:21,830
就是有条纹的那件
The one with the-- with the stripes, the...

1497
01:26:21,850 --> 01:26:23,430
你动了吗？收起来了？
Did you move it? Did you put it somewhere?

1498
01:26:23,450 --> 01:26:25,250
没有啊 我没动
No, I didn't touch it.

1499
01:26:26,150 --> 01:26:29,700
肯定是丹尼斯偷了 那个冒牌的混蛋
I bet Dennis stole it, that fake twin fucker.

1500
01:26:29,730 --> 01:26:31,070
别急 会找到的
I'm sure it'll turn up.

1501
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:33,800
你丫的凭啥就这么确定？
Yeah, how the fuck do you know that?

1502
01:26:37,030 --> 01:26:37,970
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1503
01:26:37,990 --> 01:26:39,280
不能那样跟我说话
You can't talk to me like that.

1504
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:40,930
我知道 对不起
I know. I'm sorry.

1505
01:26:41,470 --> 01:26:43,240
对不起 对不起
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1506
01:26:46,970 --> 01:26:48,830
我原谅你
I forgive you.

1507
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:52,620
可我不配
I don't deserve it.

1508
01:26:54,770 --> 01:26:57,530
原谅和配得上是两码事
Deservedness is not a requisite for forgiveness.

1509
01:27:03,460 --> 01:27:05,970
我来帮你找
I'll help you look.

1510
01:27:44,150 --> 01:27:46,990
- 现在不行 - 那什么时候？
- Not right now. - When?

1511
01:27:48,210 --> 01:27:51,350
- 再忍半小时 - 你半小时前也是这么说的
- Thirty more minutes. - You said that 30 minutes ago.

1512
01:27:51,370 --> 01:27:54,370
好吧 就当是
Well, think of it like

1513
01:27:55,180 --> 01:27:57,820
吊你胃口吧
edging.

1514
01:28:04,310 --> 01:28:05,990
别闹呀
Oh, no.

1515
01:28:16,530 --> 01:28:18,510
晚饭你想吃啥？
What do you want to do for dinner tonight?

1516
01:28:18,530 --> 01:28:20,810
我今晚去雪莉家 你忘了？
I'm going to Shelly's, remember?

1517
01:28:20,830 --> 01:28:23,270
哦 忘了
Oh. Forgot.

1518
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:28,310
能一起去吗？
Can I come?

1519
01:28:28,330 --> 01:28:29,860
这是女生聚会
It's girls' night.

1520
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:32,530
- 我们说过的 - 好 行吧
- We talked about this. - Okay. Fine.

1521
01:28:32,550 --> 01:28:36,630
- 别一副闷闷不乐的样子 - 我才没有
- Don't mope. - I'm not moping.

1522
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:24,680
抱歉 排队耽误了
Sorry, there was a line.

1523
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:26,630
我待不了太久
I can't stay long.

1524
01:29:31,610 --> 01:29:33,250
- 谢谢 - 请慢用
- Thank you. - Sure thing.

1525
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:37,550
抱歉 不该点的
Sorry, I shouldn't have ordered anything.

1526
01:29:38,870 --> 01:29:41,740
- 来点三明治？ - 不用了
- Do you want my sandwich? - No, I'm good.

1527
01:29:51,890 --> 01:29:53,930
{\an1}我升职了
I got a promotion.

1528
01:29:51,890 --> 01:29:53,930
{\an3}最近好吗？
How are you?

1529
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:56,280
恭喜啊
Congrats.

1530
01:29:56,660 --> 01:30:00,480
谢了 就是一次小乔迁吧
Thanks. Sort of. It's a ladder move.

1531
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:03,820
请的哪家搬家公司？
Lateral move?

1532
01:30:03,850 --> 01:30:05,140
啥？
What?

1533
01:30:05,170 --> 01:30:08,320
“乔迁”意思是搬家
Lateral. you're moving sideways.

1534
01:30:08,350 --> 01:30:10,000
指的是迁入新居
I guess you could have a sideways ladder,

1535
01:30:10,030 --> 01:30:13,020
升职都说“升迁”
but I can't think of a use for it.

1536
01:30:13,570 --> 01:30:14,540
靠
Fuck.

1537
01:30:16,050 --> 01:30:19,660
我跟一堆人都说“我乔迁了”
I said "ladder move" to, like, so many people.

1538
01:30:20,670 --> 01:30:24,240
升职有时也得搬家
Well, monkey bars. That's a sideways ladder.

1539
01:30:24,260 --> 01:30:25,230
行吧
Great.

1540
01:30:29,650 --> 01:30:32,710
你现在干嘛呢？玛茜说你辞职了
So where you working these days? Marcie said you quit.

1541
01:30:32,740 --> 01:30:35,130
其实是被炒了 不过谢谢她给我留面子
Fired, but that's sweet of her.

1542
01:30:35,170 --> 01:30:39,420
我正在考房产经纪人证 这次是真的
I'm in the process of getting my real estate license.

1543
01:30:41,350 --> 01:30:43,090
什么 不搞封面设计了？
What, no book designing?

1544
01:30:43,110 --> 01:30:45,940
我决定宁愿累成狗
I decided I'd rather be middle class and unhappy

1545
01:30:45,970 --> 01:30:48,810
也不愿穷乐呵
than poor and slightly less unhappy.

1546
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:51,580
嗯 能理解
Yeah. Makes sense.

1547
01:30:51,690 --> 01:30:54,450
不过话说回来 我确实...
And that said, I did...

1548
01:30:57,530 --> 01:31:01,010
不知道是不是挺没品的
Wasn't sure if it was in poor taste or not, but...

1549
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:07,230
确实挺没品的
Think it's definitely poor taste.

1550
01:31:07,260 --> 01:31:09,050
{\an8}（书名：《爱心树》）

1551
01:31:09,070 --> 01:31:10,680
嗯 我懂了
Yeah, I can see that now.

1552
01:31:11,530 --> 01:31:13,250
- 算了 我拿回去吧  - 不
- I can take it... - No, no, I'll...

1553
01:31:13,270 --> 01:31:16,180
我会留着的
I'll keep it.

1554
01:31:24,550 --> 01:31:26,910
是我把你胳膊打断的吗？
Did I break your arm?

1555
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:30,190
不全怪你
Uh, unrelated. Sort of.

1556
01:31:31,270 --> 01:31:32,610
对不起
Sorry.

1557
01:31:33,090 --> 01:31:35,210
之前那样打你 我很抱歉
For hitting you like I did.

1558
01:31:37,430 --> 01:31:38,890
没关系
It's all right.

1559
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:41,740
不 真的不对 我不该动手
No, it's not. I shouldn't have done that.

1560
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:46,280
要比谁更伤人 我更在行
I think I outclassed you in that department.

1561
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:50,110
嗯 我就是不太...
Yeah, I just don't, um...

1562
01:31:51,650 --> 01:31:55,330
不太懂 怎么会有人...
I don't understand how someone could...

1563
01:31:57,880 --> 01:32:00,790
你到底是什么样的人
I mean, who are you?

1564
01:32:03,170 --> 01:32:06,360
大家都说“做你自己”
You know how people say "just be yourself"?

1565
01:32:08,130 --> 01:32:13,620
可哪个自己啊？我不喜欢大部分的我
Like, what version of me? I hate most of them.

1566
01:32:13,870 --> 01:32:17,540
但跟你在一起的那个我...
But the version of me that was just hanging out with you, I...

1567
01:32:20,220 --> 01:32:23,460
我想永远变成他
I wanted to be him all the time.

1568
01:32:31,490 --> 01:32:33,080
所以 你...
So, you--

1569
01:32:33,250 --> 01:32:36,620
你说你爱过罗基
you said you were in love with Rock.

1570
01:32:38,270 --> 01:32:41,310
不过我得说 我有点精神问题
With the caveat that I am insane.

1571
01:32:41,790 --> 01:32:43,990
他跟你聊过我吗？
He ever talk about me?

1572
01:32:44,940 --> 01:32:46,480
要我细说吗？
Do you want details?

1573
01:32:56,790 --> 01:32:58,210
来点三明治？
Do you want my sandwich?

1574
01:32:58,230 --> 01:33:01,080
不用了 我等下要跟玛茜吃晚饭
No, I'm going to dinner with Marcie.

1575
01:33:02,370 --> 01:33:04,380
所以我待不了太久
So I can't stay long.

1576
01:33:05,350 --> 01:33:07,440
对 你刚说过
Right. You said.

1577
01:33:09,820 --> 01:33:11,650
对了 玛茜最近怎么样？
How is Marcie, by the way?

1578
01:33:12,010 --> 01:33:15,270
玛茜那边每天都是晴天
Every day is a good day in Marcie-land.

1579
01:33:15,380 --> 01:33:17,380
可不是嘛
I remember.

1580
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:25,790
我就尝一口
I'll just have a bite.

1581
01:33:28,270 --> 01:33:29,710
好吃
Hmm.

1582
01:33:29,860 --> 01:33:32,450
我又去学空手道了
I started taking karate again.

1583
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:38,500
班里有个瘦的人 挺像你的
There's a skinny guy in my class, reminds me of you.

1584
01:33:39,420 --> 01:33:41,620
课堂不是没用吗？
Aren't those classes useless?

1585
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:44,630
听说得在街头打才能学出来
I hear you can only really learn how to fight in the streets.

1586
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:47,440
嗯 我们也在街头上打
Well, we learn in the streets too.

1587
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:52,100
我那师父 下班后还偷袭我
My sensei, he, uh, follows me after work and attacks me.

1588
01:34:00,110 --> 01:34:01,270
如果情形不同
Do you think we would've been friends

1589
01:34:01,290 --> 01:34:03,760
我们会做朋友吗？
if we met under different circumstances?

1590
01:34:15,690 --> 01:34:17,280
不知道
I don't know.

1591
01:34:18,570 --> 01:34:20,810
我愿意这么想 但...
I'd like to think so, but...

1592
01:34:21,830 --> 01:34:22,970
嗯
Right.

1593
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,720
天呐 这石膏真是痒死人了
God, this cast is so itchy.

1594
01:34:30,750 --> 01:34:33,610
- 还得戴多久？ - 一个月
- How long you have it on for? - A month.

1595
01:34:34,010 --> 01:34:35,860
记得别沾水
Keep it dry.

1596
01:34:39,460 --> 01:34:43,220
罗基说有次你把脚弄骨折了
Rocky said you broke your own foot once.

1597
01:34:48,690 --> 01:34:50,470
他跟你说过？
He told you that?

1598
01:34:51,010 --> 01:34:53,670
是拿保龄球砸的吗？
You dropped a bowling ball on it?

1599
01:34:54,780 --> 01:34:58,610
他说双胞胎里 你才是好的一方
He said you were... the good twin.

1600
01:35:09,510 --> 01:35:11,560
其实是砖头砸的
It was with a brick.

1601
01:35:16,710 --> 01:35:19,490
二位吃得好吗？还需要点什么？
How are y'all doing? Can I get you anything?

1602
01:35:19,820 --> 01:35:22,280
{\an1}我们要个打包盒
Can we get a box to go?

1603
01:35:19,820 --> 01:35:22,280
{\an3}我们要个打包盒
Can we get a box to go?

1604
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:23,450
没问题
